---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bands:
2.4GHz covering a 100 MHz range of 2400MHz to 2500MHz. It is splited into 14 descrete channels that are
20 MHz each.  Channels 1, 6, 11 and 14 do not overlap
5GHz covers a 150 MHz range from 5.725MHz to 5.875MHz, additional range of Unlicensed National
Information Infrastructure (UNII) bands widens that range to 750MHz.
Note, router supporting both bands is considered to be dual band.

Well known standards/specctrum:
.11a  | an early 5GHz 54Mbps Wi-Fi standard
.11b  | early 2.4GHz 11Mbps version of Wi-Fi
.11g  | increased 2.4GHz Wi-Fi speed up to 54Mbps
.11n  | "Wi-Fi 4" supports both 2.4GHz and 5GHz Wi-Fi at speeds up to 450 Mbps
.11ac | "Wi-Fi 5" supports 5GHz only and speeds of up to 1300 Mbps
.11ax | "Wi-Fi 6" supports both 2.4GHz and 5GHz and has a maximum speed of up to 10Gpbs

Channel bonding. Some standarts introduced idea of channel bonding - merging multiple 20MHz channels
into a single 40/80/160 MHz channels. This is expected to improve performance, howeverm it also reduces
the number of non-overlapping channels, therefore, increasing the probability for interference.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wireless STA (station) => any device that join a WiFi network
RF => radio frequency
 
BSS(basic service set) => two or more STA connected and controlled with wireless medium (such as a NIC)
that communicate with each other.

IBSS (independent BSS) => stations communicate directly with each other therefore must be within direct
communication range

ESS(extended service set) => DS (Distribution System) + and two plus BSS

BSSID => 48 bit id that identifies bss, used for filtering in frames
- in a infrastructure BSS it will be MAC of wireless interface
- in IBSS it is generated
- all 1s is broadcast BSSID (send by station to identifie network with 
probe request). Only probe frames are allowed to use broadcast

SSID => 48 bit service set identity

IAPP (inter-access point protocol) => method of cominicating association info
Station can be associated only with one AP a time therefore other should be notified.

CF (coordination function) which determines when a STA transmits/receives


Operatiog Modes
- infrastructure
- ad-hoc => pear to pear connection

 Positive acknowledgment => all transmitted frames must be acknowledged, it trasfer
is failed, the frame is considered lost

RTS => Request to send
- reserver radio link for transmission + silences any stations that hear it
- if target hears it , sends back CTS (Clear to send) + silence
 ? Why we need to silence neighbours =>
   wifi link is half duplex therefore if there is hidden node between 
   stations and it receives RTS from two station trying to initiate connection
   it will collide, therefore we want only 1 station to speek a time
- after RTS/CTS any frames must be positively acknowledged
- this mechanism is expansive therefore it is only used in high-capacity 
  environments or can be configured to be applied form big frames


DCG => distributed coordinative function
- checks that link is clear before transmiting
? What is the difference between this and coordination functions

Ways of controlling wireless medium
- DCF (distributed coordination function)
- PCF (point coordination function)
- HCG (hybrid)

CCA => clear channel assertment
- physical way of checking channel

Carier sensing =>
- used to determine if the medium is available

NAV (Network Allocation Vector) =>
- virtual way of checking a channel
- timer on host that accumulates time need to send frame(s)
- time filed within frame send that reserves a medium
- shorter NAV is sent with CTS in case some station missed NAV in RTS
- ACK resets medium NAV

Interframe spacing =>
- SIFS (Short interframe space) => used for highest priority transmissions. They can begin
as soon, as SIFS finishes
- PIFS ( PCF interframe space ) => used by stations with data to transmit in the contention-
free period
- DIFS ( DCF interframe space ) => 
- EIFS => used when there is an error in frame trasmission



NULL data frame =>
- data frame used by STA to notify AP about going to sleep
- it sets PM(Power Managment) bit to 1
- AP never sends this frame nor gos to sleep
- AP will buffer all frames for this STA

PS-Poll (PowerSave-Poll) frame =>
- frame sent by STA when waking up from sleep
- asks AP to send buffered frames
- AP can acknowladge this frame without sending data if it wants.
  In this case STA cannot sleep untill AP sends data
- Data end is notified with special frame beacon
- It doesnt update NAV but all stations receive it and update NAV for
  short  interframe space by themselves
- Instead of NAV is send AID (Association ID ,in range 1 - 2007)

Managment frame =>
* Beacon =>
- annouunce the existence of a network

* Probe Request =>
- is used by STA to find networks
- contains SSID and STA supported rates 

* Probe Response =>
- frame send to probe request
- is sent by STA that was last to send beacon

* ATIM (announcement traffic indication map) =>
- is sent in IBSS if STA has buffered frames
 to notify sleeping receiver

* Disassociation and Deauthentication
- sends reason code

* Association request =>

* Reassociation Request =>
- includes current AP address so new one can communicate with it
  and ask for STA information

* Association response and reassociation response

* Authentication

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                  Bandsteering 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Feature that encourages dual-band-capable clients to stay on the 5ghz band on dual-band APs. If client
conects to 5GHz we remeber it and then miss requests for reassosiation with 2GHz. After 8 probe request
in 10 secconds, client is allowed to associate with 2.4GHz AP.
Band steering feature automatically selects between 80MHz, 40 MHz or 20 MHz channels in 802.11n networks?
When AP hears a request from a client device to associate on both the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands, it steers
the client by responding only to 5GHz association request and not the 2.4GHz. Note that both APs on
gateway are supposed to have the same configuration, like SSID name, security type and settongs, VLAN
assignments. If they all matchm then it may get enabled automatically or there will be option to be
enabled by user. 

AP may be configured in one of the following modes =>
1. Prefer 5GHz
2. Force 5GHz
3. Band Balance

The main problem of steering is that it is not standartized therefore each vendor has it`s own
impelementation and modes of running, as said above. As the result, network connection may be not reliable
for some devices, or they may prefer 2.4GHz band when 5GHz is optimal.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                               Measurement units
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RSSI (received signal strength). 8bit value arbitrary used by vendor to describe signal strength. There
is no standart for its measurement therefore it is not valid to compare rssi used by different manufactures.

RCPI (received channel power indicator)

RSNI (received signal-to-noise indicator)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                  Wifi Roaming
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When a wireless client moves around in an area with multiple AP, it may automatically switch to another
AP which has better signal strength. In this case APs are required to have the same SSID and prorection
configuration. Decision whether to roam or not is client choise. However, on some gateways there is
AP-Assisted Roaming optionl which will kick of sticky clients and make them transfer to the optimized
connection.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    Hotspot
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hotspot => referes to physical location typically public places served by an AP used to connect devices to
one another using WiFi; friendly/marketing term to qualify an AP that offers wifi access for guest users.
If your AP has open SSID (no password?) then it can be considered an Hotspot; A hotspot is a common public
application of WAPs, where wireless clients can  connect to the Internet without regard for the particular
networks to  which they have attached for the moment

                                  Wifi bridge
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In case you need to connect to networks over wireless connecton you can create a bridge.
To do this you need one router wich is connected to internet or just one network router and antwork
that should be connect need a wireless access point (not a router) that will be assosiated with
previous router. This AP should to be run in the bridge AP mode in which it will communicate only with
your configured router

TODO
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                      Wifi booster vs repeater vs extender
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Booster => extends wifi network coverage space by boosting or amplifying existing signals.

Repeater => wirelessly connected to your network, receive the wireless signal from your router
and then repeat that signal to a new area extending WIFI coverage. It doesnt require
physical connection. It will conect to your route and client simultaniously, therefore available
bandwidth is cut in half.

Extender => physically connected to your network via a wired connection, offering much faster
speed and a stronger coverage. These device acts as another wireless router. They therefore
create a different network to transmit coverage, which means they can operate on a different
frequency from your existing router. You will have to deal with manually switching your connected
device`s WIFI connection to the right SSID.

Note that extender can perform repeater functions.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                       DFS (Dynamic Frequency Selections)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DFS is a WiFi function that enables WLANs to use 5GHz frequencies that are generally reserved for radars.
Main benefit of using DFS channels is to utilize under-serviced frequencies to increase the number of
available WiFi channels. Firstly AP checks that no radar is using DFS frequencies. This process is
called Channel Availablity Check. If there is a radar on a channel, channel will be ignored for next
30 min and then repeated. Availability Check can take anywhere between 1 and 10 minutes, depending on
which country you`re in. If AP detectes radar on used channel, it will contact associtated WiFi clients
to stop transmitting on that channel and try to change DFS channel.

                                  Beamforming
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A common feature for high-end 802.11ac wireless routers. There’s no downside to getting beamforming, aside
from the money you may have to spend to get a more expensive router with this feature. Note that your
device is supposed to support 802.11ac, othrewise this feature can`t be used.

WMN (Wireless Mesh Network) => network made up of radio nodes organized in a mesh topology.

       WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup, originally Wi-Fi Simple Configuration)
=========================================================================================================
WPS is a network security standard to create a secure wireless home network;
is a method of connecting to gateway without knowing its password. This is commonly used for first time
logging, allwing client to reconfigure password. This is done via an external or internal registrar.
These methods include:
1. Push Button (PBC), external registrar. User has to push a button, either an actual or virtual one, on
   both the access point and the new wireless client device. On most devices, this discovery mode turns
   itself off as soon as a connection is established or after a delay (typically 2 minutes or less),
   whichever comes first, thereby minimizing its vulnerability.
   Method is optional.
2. PIN entry. A unique PIN  will be required for each device to join the network. A fixed PIN label or
   sticker may be placed on a device, or a dynamic PIN can be generated and shown on the device's display
   (e.g., a TV screen or monitor). PIN is used to make sure the intended device is added to the network
   being set up and will help to avoid accidental or malicious attempts to add unintended devices to the
   network. Method is required to be implemented.
3. Near Field Communication (NFC). Usually not used nor is required to be implemented.

Wi-Fi Simple Configuration defines new 802.11 information elements (IE) that are included in beacons,
probe requests and probe responses. The purpose of these IEs is to advertise the presence of devices that
are capable of performing Wi-Fi Simple Configuration operations.

Definitions used in architecture:
1. Domain. A set of 1+  devices controlled by a common authority for the purpose of gaining access to 1+ WLANs.
2. Enrollee. A device seeking to join a WLAN Domain. Once an Enrollee obtains a valid credential, it
   becomes a Member.
3. In-band. Data transfer using the WLAN communication channel
4. Out-of-band. Data transfer using a communication channel other than the WLAN
5. Registration Protocol. A Registration Protocol is a (logically) three party in-band protocol to assign
   a Credential to the Enrollee. The protocol operates between the Enrollee and the Registrar and may
   receive support through a proxy.
6. Registrar. An entity with the authority to issue and revoke Domain Credentials. A Registrar may be
   integrated into an AP (internal Registrar), or it may be separate from the AP (external Registrar).
   A Registrar may not have WLAN capability.  A given Domain may have multiple Registrars.
7. External Registrar. A Registrar for an AP’s Domain that runs on a device separate from the AP
8. PushButton Configuration (PBC). A configuration method triggered by pressing a physical or
   logical button on the Enrollee and on the Registrar.

Some wireless access points have a dual-function WPS button, and holding this button down for a shorter
or longer time may have other functions, such as factory-reset or toggling WiFi.

                               Beacon frame
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Wi Fi Beacon management frame is a sent out by the access point every 100ms (can be configured).
Beacon frames are used to advertise that the existence of a wireless access point is available and contains
all the required information required to connect to the network. It contains follwing information:
1. Beacon Interval. Interface at which beacons are transmitted by AP, needed by devices in power save mode
   so they wake only when needed.
2. Timestamp. This details the local time of the access point so all local device can use this information
   to synchronize their time.
3. SSID. This field details the network name associated with the access point. If the network is hidden
   then there will be no information in this field. A client will need to know the SSID in its probe
   request, if it wants to connect to this access point.
4. Supported rates. This determines the supported data rates by the access points
5. Parameter sets. This describes the supported signaling rates i.e frequency hopping spread spectrum etc
6. Capability information. This field defines the capabilities that the client will need to support in
   order to connect with the access point.
7. Traffic Indication Map (TIM). An access point periodically sends the TIM within a beacon to identify
   which stations using power saving mode have data frames waiting for them in the access point’s buffer.
8. Fixed Parameter contains information like if wep is being supported being used and what type of
   modulation is being used.
There are also fields that hold  extra parameters, that has been added to the Wi FI spec since its first
initial standard. This information can be found under tagged parameters.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                             Probe Request/Response
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Station looking for network may do it passively by iterating through possible channels and listening to
beacons but it is not efficient (passive scanning). Instead, active stations, iterate through channels
and send a Prob Request management frame asking what network is available on that channel.
It`s broadcasted to DestinationAddress (ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff). Once a Probe sent, STA starts a ProbeTimer
countdown & wait for answers. At the end of the timer, STA process the answer it has received. If no
answers received, STA moves to next channel & repeats the discovery process.

STA sending Probe Request may specify the SSID they looking (called directed probe request). Then only
IBSS STA or AP support that SSID will answer. The SSID value can also be set to 0 (ie SSID field is
present, but empty). This is called Wildcard SSID or Null Probe Request.

Beacon frame and Probe response are similar but here are 3 noticable differences:
1. The beacon frame contain a TIM, the probe response does not
2. The beacon frame contain a QoS Capability information Element
3. The probe response contain the Requested Information elements that may have been requested by the
   probing station.

Once Probe Response received by the STA, it should send an  ACK frame to the AP.
