=========================================================================================================
PNP. Technology that offers support for automatically adding and removing devices to the system.
This reduces conflicts with the resources they use by automatically configuring them at system startup.
In order to achieve these goals, the following features are required:
- Automatic detection of adding and removing devices in the system (the device and its bus must notify the
  appropriate driver that a configuration change occurred).
- Resource management (addresses, irq lines, DMA channels, memory areas), including resource allocation to
  devices and solving conflicts that may arise.
- Devices must allow for software configuration (device resources - ports, interrupts, DMA resources - must
  allow for driver assignment).
- The drivers required for new devices must be loaded automatically by the operating system when needed.
- When the device and its bus allow, the system should be able to add or remove the device from the system
  while it is running, without having to reboot the system (hotplug).
