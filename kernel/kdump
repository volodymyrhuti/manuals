=========================================================================================================
Kdump. Way to acquire a crashed Linux kernel dump, but finding documents that explain its usage and
internals can be challenging. It relies on kexec, which can be used to boot a Linux kernel from the context
of another kernel, bypass BIOS, and preserve the contents of the first kernelâ€™s memory that would otherwise
be lost. 

Kexec. Linux kernel-to-kernel boot loader that helps to boot the second kernel from the context of first
kernel. Kexec shuts down the first kernel, bypasses the BIOS or firmware stage, and jumps to second kernel.
Thus, reboots become faster in absence of the BIOS stage.

Common usecase of Kdump  with the kexec: when the second kernel is booted when the first kernel panics,
the second kernel is used to copy the memory dump of first kernel, which can be analyzed with tools such
as gdb and crash to determine the panic reasons.

In order for kdump to be able to capture a kernel crash dump and save it for further analysis, a part of
the system memory has to be permanently reserved for the capture kernel. When reserved, this part of the
system memory is not available to main kernel. 

/etc/systemd/system
/run/systemd/system
/usr/local/lib/systemd/system
/usr/lib/systemd/system

The kdump service can be started by executing
  $ systemctl start kdump
When this service starts, it creates a root file system (initramfs) that contains resources to mount the
target for saving vmcore, and a command to copy/dump vmcore to the target. This service then loads the
kernel and initramfs at the suitable location within the crash kernel region so that they can be executed
upon kernel panic.

Possible configuration files:
- `/etc/kdump.conf` specifies configuration parameters whose modification requires rebuild of the initramfs.
   For example, if you change the dump target from a local disk to an NFS-mounted disk, you will need
   NFS-related kernel modules to be loaded by the capture kernel.
- `/etc/sysconfig/kdump` specifies configuration parameters whose modification do not require rebuild of
   the initramfs. For example, you do not need to rebuild the initramfs if you only need to modify
   command-line arguments passed to the capture kernel.
