This is my knowledge base, or at least a part that is more or less structured and well explained.
Purpose of this project, is to collect short notes on things I`m studing, therefore it can be
read later for repetition or used as a reference.

Most of notes are expected to have links/references to resources from which this data was taken.
This way, if some deeper explanation is required, user can look through resources without researching
hundreds of web pages to find 1 or 2 crucial sentences.

All notes are expected to follow next rulles:
- Themes are outline with lines of `=` characters.
- Subject are outlined with lines of `-` characters
- Line lenght 105 characters (I like to highlight it with :set colorcolumn=105)
- Topics are center aligned using vim `:center` without arguments (80 by default)
- Shell commands have some indentation so it`s clear visible from rest of the text
- Each file has it`s own set of separator used for different context, e.g.
  comments to shell comands are explained after `#` separator, so it can be easily copied
- Topics preferrably should contain examples inplace
