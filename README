This is my knowledge base, or at least a part that is more or less structured and well explained.
Purpose of this project, is to make short description of things I`m studing, therefore I can read
the most important parts here, when I need it again. Most of notes are expected to have links/references
to resources from which this data was taken. Therefore, if some deeper explanation is required, you
can look through resources without parsing hundreds of web pages to find one or two crucial sentences.
It was created when I noticed that there is to much of information that I start to forget things.
Hope, this can be usefull for somebody, except me)

All notes are expected to follow next rulles:
Themes are outline with lines of `=` characters.
Subject are outlined with lines of `-` characters
Line lenght 105 characters (I like to highlight it with :set colorcolumn=105)
Theme names are center aligned using vim `:center` without arguments (80 by default)
Definitions are usually of form 
`#Number. Definition name. Expansiong of symbols. Description`

Consider writing command exmaples from a new line and comment to the right after #,
therefore it can be copied as entire line within text editor of choise and paster to shell
