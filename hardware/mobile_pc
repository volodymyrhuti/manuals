---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subnotebook. Mini notebook. Small laptop/notebook with:
- Display screen less than 14 inches
- Weighs less than 4.4 pounds
- At least 30 GB local storage (HDD or SSD)
- Uses a computer processor (such as Intel Atom or Celeron CPU, or AMD equivalent)
- Runs full desktop operating systems (such as Windows or Linux).
- Typically omit ports, removable media or optical disc drives to reduce weight
  Many offer optional docking stations to compensate.

Netbook. Small, low cost subnotebook, designed to sacrifice performance for smaller size, battery and
affordability.
- Display screen less than 10 inches
- Reduced power processor (such as Intel's older "Atom")
- No more than 2 GB of RAM
- Optimized for portable access to the Internet

Smartbook. ARM based mobile device combining smartphone and netbook features such as:
- always on, all-day battery life
- 3G or Wi-Fi connectivity and GPS in a laptop or tablet-style body
- screen size of 5 to 10 inches and a physical or touchscreen keyboard

Promoted as "a truly pocketable computer" in 2009 and 2010 but marginalized by trademark disputes,
difficulties adapting Adobe's Flash to ARM architecture, and the overwhelming success of tablets such as
the iPad.

Ultrabook. Very thin and light-weight laptop that incorporates some tablet features (such as touch screen
and extended  battery life), uses an Intel Core processor, and meets Intel's specifications for the
Ultrabookâ„¢ trademark.

Sleekbook. Thin and lightweight laptop, very similar to an Ultrabook form but built on an AMD rather than
Intel computing platform. May come with or without a touchscreen, and tend to be more affordable than Ultrabooks.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chromebook/Cloudbook. Thin, lightweight cloud-based notebook computer that runs Google's "Chrome OS"
and browser. Because the only software application that Chrome OS can run locally is a special version
of Google's Chrome browser, a Chromebook is often described as a browser-in-a-box.

User files and applications (including printer controls) are stored remotely on Google's virtual servers
(in the cloud), and can be accessed through a Chrome browser on any computing device (including Android
4.0+ phones and tablets).

Chromebooks cannot run client (legacy) software (used in standalone computers), cannot run any browser
other than its own version of Chrome, and does not support any browser plug-ins.

Chromebooks tend to be relatively inexpensive, with most selling between $199 to $299.

                                   Tablets
=========================================================================================================
Tablet computer. Tablet. Generally refers to a range of different touch-screen devices; notebook-sized
mobile computers, equipped with touchscreens, typically used wirelessly. Common models include:
- Apple's iPad Air 2
- Google's Pixel C
- Samsung's Galaxy Tab S2
- Microsoft's Surface
- and Amazon's Kindle Fire

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    Features
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Portability is one of the main reasons for selecting a tablet computer over another type of device.
  Tablet computers are smaller, thinner, and more lightweight than laptop computers. The screen size is
  larger than that of a smartphone, making it easier to read and navigate the touchscreen.
- Connectivity is another key feature. Like a smartphone, a tablet computer is designed to operate
  wirelessly, either over a Wi-Fi network or via a 3G or 4G cell phone network.
- Compatibility is another feature of a tablet computer. Many tablets share operating systems (OS) with
  smartphones or computers, making it relatively easy to sync data back and forth.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                               Specifications
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Types. One may be simply a tablet, while another has an attached keyboard or is designed to operate in
extreme conditions.

- Slate. Traditional standalone tablet. E.g. Apple iPad or Samsung Galaxy Tab.
  Used for consumer activity and occasionally in professional and industrial applications.
  Have been popular for years in vertical markets such as health care, education, hospitality, aviation
  (pilot documentation and maps), and field work.
  May come in regular or mini sizes.
- Convertible. Has an attached full keyboard.
  The keyboard can be folded behind the screen so the device can be held as a tablet. It can also lie in
  front of the screen like a laptop computer.
- Booklet. Tablet computers with two screens.
  The device opens like a book with a screen on each side. 
  Can be used as a notebook by displaying a virtual keyboard on one of the screens.
  Aid in multi-tasking and may accommodate handwriting recognition.
- Mini-tablet. 8 inches or less diagonally.
  One-piece tablet designed for one-hand operation and to more readily slip into users' pocket or purse.
  Feature set differs to accommodate smaller size and reduced purchase price.
- Phablet. Phone-Tablet. Crossover phone-tablet. 5 to 7 inches
  Larger than Smartphone but smaller and thinner than typical tablets, and designed to combine or
  straddle the functionalities of a Smartphone and tablet
- Gaming. Some tablets are modified by adding physical gamepad buttons such as D-pad and thumb sticks for
  better gaming experience combined with the touchscreen and all other features of a typical tablet
  computer. Most of these tablets are targeted to run native OS games and emulator games.
- Rugged. Designed for use in environments where less durable tablets would break or fail to operate.
  According to MobileDemand, a standard tablet that "spends more than 40% of its time outside of the office"
  has an annual failure rate of "more than 30% per device."
  Failure rates for rugged tablets in similar conditions are less than 4% per year.

  They are durable and shockproof to withstand research, military, construction, or other outdoor work.
  Some conditions that rugged tablets are built to
  - Extremely high or low temperatures
  - Vibration
  - Dusty conditions
  - Direct sunlight
  - Wet conditions
  - Drops onto hard surfaces 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OS. A number of OS are available for tablet computers. These can be specific to a certain manufacturer.
For example, iPads are manufactured by Apple and will carry that company's OS, called iOS.
While Google's Android platform is available on models by multiple manufacturers.

Software designed for use on personal computers cannot be installed on most tablet computers.
Each OS is compatible with certain apps developed for it.
OS                  |  Devices                             | Market Share %
iOS      Apple      | iPads, iPhones, iPods                | 55.3 
Android  Google     | Many tablets and smartphones, Nexus, | 44.58
                    | Samsung                              |
Windows  Microsoft  | Surface Tablets, smartphones, and    | 0.06
                    | computers                            |
Linux               |                                      | 0.03
Blackberry RIM      | Blackberry tablets and cell phones   | 0.01

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Size. Sizing for tablet computers is typically broken down into two categories:
- 6 to 8 inch 
- 9 to 13 inch

Smaller models weigh less and may lack certain features such as cameras.
Selecting a tablet computer size should be based on the desired application and whether compactness or a
larger functional screen size is more important.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Processor. Processors vary by manufacturer. Apple, for instance, has its own processors;
other manufacturers may use Intel or ARM processors.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Storage. Because tablet computers are meant to be used wirelessly, data to be accessed is stored on the
device itself or possibly in cloud storage.

While some devices have a slot for a micro SD card to expand memory, in most cases there is no connection
to other storage devices such as USB drives or portable hard drives. The memory on the device will
determine how much media like photos, music, video, or other large files can be stored.

Internal memory cannot be expanded at a later time and can range from 1GB to 500GB, although 8GB - 64GB
are the most common sizes for consumer tablet computers

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battery. The battery life of a tablet computer depends on a number of factors:
- Battery size
- Screen backlight brightness
- Operating system efficiency
- Sleep mode vs. powering down the tablet
- App usage
- Browsing the web
- Streaming video

Many tablets advertise 6 to 11 hours of battery life.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Screen Type. Actions such as tapping, swiping, and turning the device can produce different results.
A stylus, or rubber-tipped pen, can be used instead of a finger to press a button or write on the screen.

- Capacitive Touchscreens (most common)
  These screens respond to skin touch rather than pressure and have less accuracy for handwriting unless
  used with specialized apps.

  The capacitive touchscreen allows additional actions such as swiping, pinching, and expanding items on
  the screen. The screen has a solid outer layer, such as glass, with electrostatic sensors beneath it.

- Resistive Touchscreens.
  Used in POS (point-of-sale) electronic signature pads used in retail stores and by delivery services.
  They intended for use with a stylus but can also respond to finger or fingernail pressure.
  Precision is required for accurate sensing and action.

  These screens have multiple layers with the outer layer made of a slightly flexible material.

- Active Screens are used on devices with screens that do not respond to the touch of a finger.
  A special stylus must be used with these screens, which are the best type to translate handwriting or
  drawing to a screen.

A rugged tablet computer that will be used in extreme conditions may have other screen features. The
screen may be scratch-resistant, reduce glare when viewed in direct sunlight, and be able to deal with
extreme temperature ranges.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Resolution. Number of pixels in each dimension that can be displayed. These include:
1024 x 600
1024 x 768    | Apple iPad2
1280 x 800    | Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1
1920 x 1200   | ASUS Transforemer Pad infinity
2048 x 1536   | Apple new iPad
2560 x 1600
Screen resolution for tablet computers ranges from  to . While higher numbers
generally indicate a clearer picture, at some point the numbers may exceed the resolution of the image
file or the quality of a video.

Pixel density. PPI (Pixel Per Inch). DPI (Dots Per Inch).
Measurement of the number of pixels horizontally and vertically in a square inch of space.
PPI in tablet computers can range from about 130 PPI to more than 400 PPI.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Additional features:
- Accelerometer. May be used in a device that responds to being turned, tilted, or shaken.
  The accelerometer may also provide image stabilization for a built-in camera.

  Turning a tablet computer to a vertical or horizontal orientation will change the corresponding screen
  orientation to portrait or landscape. Tilting or shaking a device may trigger a response from an app
  like a game.
  Navigation is another application of an accelerometer and may be useful in apps related to mapping and
  changes in elevation or distance.

- Handwriting recognition e.g.
- Paper drawing. You can put a peace of paper on `wacom intuos paper` and the drawing will get digitalized.
  This might support features like multiple layer registration etc...

- IR support and could work as a TV remote controller
- Speech recognition
- NFC
- Docking station, keyboard and added connectivity, on-board flash memory, ports for removable storage,
  various cloud storage services for backup and syncing data across devices, local storage on a LAN

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hardware:
- Camera. Front/Back/Both.
  Cameras vary in terms of megapixels, autofocus, flash, and incorporated microphones.
- Internet Connection. WiFi/3G/4G
- IO and Accessories.
  Connection ports and buttons vary between tablet manufacturers, most devices come with the following:
  - On/off button
  - Power connector
  - 3.5 mm headphone jack
  - Speaker
  - Volume controls and mute switch
  These may be included
  _ microSD card slot
  _ USB port
  _ Docking port
