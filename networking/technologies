Mellanox OpenFabrics Enterprise Distribution for Linux. To enable distributed computing transparently and
with maximum efficiency, applications in large and growing markets requires the highest I/O bandwidth and
lowest possible latency. These requirements are compounded with the need to support a large interoperable
ecosystem of networking, virtualization, storage, and other applications and interfaces.

The OFED from OpenFabrics Alliance (www.openfabrics.org) has been hardened through collaborative development
and testing by major high performance I/O vendors. Mellanox OFED (MLNX_OFED) is a Mellanox tested and
packaged version of OFED that supports two interconnect types using the same RDMA (remote DMA) and kernel
bypass APIs called OFED verbs â€“ InfiniBand and Ethernet.

Up to 200Gb/s InfiniBand and RoCE (based on the RDMA over Converged Ethernet standard) over 10/25/40/50/100GbE
are supported with OFED by Mellanox to enable OEMs and System Integrators to meet the needs end users in
the said markets.
