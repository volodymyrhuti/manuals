                                   Baud rate
=========================================================================================================
Baud rate. Rate at which information is trasferred in a communication channel. In the serial port context
9600 baud means that hte serial port is capable of transferring a maximum of 9600 bits/second. The higher
the baud rate, the more sensitive the cable becomes to the quality of installation, such as how much of
the wire is untwisted around each device.
The most common RS232 format requires 10 bits to send each byte, so at 9600 baud you can send 960 bytes
per second.
A baud rate can also be expressed in kHz, so 9600 baud is 9.6kHz. It means the same thing

To get characteristics of your terminal or serial port issue `stty -F /dev/ttyS<n>`
By default serial ports are configured as terminal emulator (canonical mode). If you want to use them as
"raw" serial port you will have do `stty -F /dev/tty<S0> raw -echo -echoe -echok` 
You can write/read from such device, like
echo 123 > /dev/ttyS0
cat /dev/ttyS0

=========================================================================================================
There are plenty of cable type used with modern computers, each having uniq pins, by its usage and structure.
VGA           # Also known as D-sub cable, analog video cable, is one of the oldest computer monitor cable
                types. Can be identified by 15 pins arranged in 3 rows with 5 on each row.
DVI           # Digital Visual Interface, succeeded VGA in the 2000s as video technology moved from analog
                to digital. 
HDMI          # High-Definition Multimedia Interface
              # capable of transmiting both display and sound so you can not only use your TV screen as a
                monitor, but also make use of your TV speakers to play PC audio.
                was designed to replace VGA and DVI
PS/2          # purple used for keyboards and green for mouse
Kettle Plug   # 
ThunderBolt   # Mostly seen on laptops and Apple Macs these cables are high speed and are capable of
USB-C         # carrying Data, video and other information.
Display port  # has better quality over HDMI, use if you require a fast, high-resolution image.
                was designed to replace VGA and DVI
IDE           # Integrated Drive Electronics. Was used to connect storage devices to a motherboard
SATA          # Serial Advanced Technology Attachment, was designed to succeed IDE, provides higher data
                transfer speeds
eSATA         # External SATA, an extension of, or improvement on, the SATA, makes technology available
                in an external form. Isn’t much different than SATA, but it allows connections to devices
                like external hard drives and external optical drives. However, eSATA has fallen out of
                popularity due to advancements in USB speeds.

                      GPIO (General Purpose Input Output)
=========================================================================================================
General Purpose Input Output and are pins on various processors that aren’t dedicated to anything and all
processors have at least a few. They’re designed for you to do input or output single bits. A GPIO Pin is
a single bit either input or output.  In the digital world, we have a signal above about 2.5 volts, it’s
a 1 one is below 2.5 volts is 0, so I’m just going to call them  0’s and 1’s even though they’re different.

When you actually use an input on a GPIO, sometimes you have an output device that will only pull it down.
It’s called an Open Drain and it’ll only pull something down. But it lets the input float if the device
isn’t turned on. Well, you have to deal with that because if you let it float, you don’t know whether it’s
going to end up being a 1 or a 0.

The simplest thing you might do  a hardware “Hello World”, you make an led blink on and off. You do that
by setting your pin to 1, 0, 1, 0. So you can turn it on and off, that’s using output. What about an input?
You can hook up a switch out there that has that nasty little pull up to 5 volts or  3.3 volts. 

They’re making the computers do something out in the real world. Whether it’s turning off a switch, whether
it’s turning on an LED. All these things can be done with your little computer driving those GPIO Inputs
and Outputs.

Serial Devices only use one Input, but you transmit sequences that are timed so you try 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0,
and you do that in a certain way you know it’s a byte of data. You need to know when the bytes start, not
so much with the bytes quit, but we need to know when the bytes start. That’s called Framing 

In case your device has not enough pins, you can use GPIO Extender.

laminated onto and/or betweeb sheet layers oa non-conductibe substrate. Components are both mechanically
and electrically connected to PCB. It is used for everythin except the simplest electronic products.
This about it as plastick sheet covered with elements and paths that interconnect them. Alternatives wire
wrap and point to point construction.

Wire wrap => electronic components mounted on insulating board are interconnected by lenghs of insulated
wire run between their terminals, with the connections made by wrapping several turns of uninsulated sections
of the wire around a component lead or a socket pin. It is old techology used for telephone switches and
later used for prototyping since it can be well automated and easily fixed by hand.

  ISA
=========================================================================================================
Instruction Set Architecture is an abstract model of a computer, commonly refererred to as architecture;
the part of the processor that is visible to the programmer or compiler writer;  boundary between software
and hardware;
In general, ISA defines following
- supported data types (words, strings, characters)
- CPU states (main memory and registers)
- state semantics (memory consistence, addressing modes)
- instruction set (set of machine instructions)
- endianness

Let`s consider the design of an ISA as an engineering problem.
ISA specifies how programs are to be encoded for a family of computers sharing that architecture. Once
coded in a specific ISA, a program can generally be run on various machines sharing that ISA provided
sufficient memory and I/O resources are available. In this respect, an ISAN is engineering abstraction:
it specifies an interface between hardware and software, and -- like other engineering abstractions --
allows both technologies to evolve independetly.
There is a range of requirements:
- Cost/performance
- Cost/performance scalling
- Model of computation
- Backward compatibility
- Future compatibility

The ISA of a processor can be described using 5 categories:
- Operand Storage in the CPU
- Number of explicit named operands - how many operands are named in a typical instruction
  Maximal number of operands, like a three-operand bs two-operand architecture ?

RTL (Register Transfer Language). Assembly like language used to describe data flow at the register-transfer
leverl of an architecture. Academic papers and textbooks often use a form of RTL as an architecture-neutral
assembly language.

ISA implementation for a specific processor is called a microarchitecture.
For instance, x86 ISA was implemented in following microarchitectures:
8086       | the first x86 processor
286        | the first with protected mode including segmentation based virtual memory managment.
i386       | the first 32bit x86 processor
i486       | intoduced built-in FPU
P5         | original Pentium microprocessor
Intel Core | reengineered P6-based microarchitecture
Haswell    | 22nm microarchitecture
Skylake    | 14nm microarchitecture

Examples of ISA are: load-store architecture,

A CPU socket (or slot) is a single connector between a microprocessor and motherboard. It is a distinct
mount used only for the CPU on the motherboard to ensure correct circuit chip insertion. It facilitates
CPU access and prevents damage when a unit is inserted or removed. A CPU socket also has a lock to prevent
CPU movement, and its design helps secure heat sink placement above the CPU.

architecture.

x86 started with 16bit instruction set for 16bit processors (8086 and 8088 processors). Later x86 was
exteded with 32bit inststruction set for 32bit processors (80386 and 80486) and was commonly referred as
80x86, where x stands for variable chip model number. Later x86 was extended with 64bit instruction and
somewhere along the line the 80 in the front was dropped, leaving just x86. The first 64bit extension to
the x86 was made by AMD, initially called x86-64.

Modern CPU sockets and processors are based on a pin grid array (PGA) architecture. PGA is a type of
packaging used for integrated circuits (IC), such as a microprocessor. It is basically a square with pins
that are organized below the packaging. Pins are spaced approximately 0.1 inches (2.54 mm) apart to cover
a portion or entire underside of the package.

                                   Structure
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some outdeted terminology:
Frontside Bus. When L2 cache was developed, the connection between the data bus (CPU, MCC, RAM) + address bus 
were lumped into a single term called the frontside bus.
Backside Bus. The connection between the CPU and the L2 cache.

IMC. Integrated Memory Controller
Old CPUs had MMC (memory controller connection CPU to the RAM) on the motherboard.
All current microprocessors have an Integrated Memory Controller moved into CPU to optimize the flow of
information into and out from the CPU. It enables faster control over things like the large L3 cache
shared among multiple cores.
Just like in many other areas of computing, most manufacturers have different ways of implementing it,
therefore, CPUs support different types an capacities of RAM.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                     Metrics
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here is what to look for when you choose a CPU:
1. Clock speeds. Measured in gigahertz (GHz), this is the speed at which the chip operates, so higher is
   faster. Most CPUs change speed dynamically depending on type/amount of work it is dooing therefore it
   should be mention min/max speed.
2. Cores. Amout of processors withing the CPU. Each one is capable of handling its own tasks in parralel
   with others.
3. Threads. How many proccesses can be runned at once. In theory, it is expected to have one core running
   one process at a time, however it may support hyper threading when some part of core can executed
   independantly from other.
4. TDP. The Thermal Design Profile/Power. How much heat a busy CPU generates, measured in watts.
   The maximum amout of heat that chip generates at stock speed. You need to care about this to choose
   proper CPU cooler. Don`t forget about overcloking wich may create more heat then you expect.
   Typicall TDP for smartphone is 2-15 watts, laptop 7-65 watts, desctops 50-140 watts.
5. Cache.
6. IPC. Instructions Per Cycle. You may have two CPUs that have the same clock spped, amount of cores and
   threads but from different companies which really makes their perfomance different.

Different processors require different socket types, therefore, if you already have an motherboard and
don`t want to replace it, you`ll need to purchase a CPU that matches you board`s socket.

                                CPU Clocks
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In a computer, clock speed refers to the number of pulses per second generated by an oscillator that are
used to synchronize the operations of its components, and is used as an indicator of the processor`s speed.

CPU clock speed, or clock rate, is measured in Hertz — generally in gigahertz, or GHz. A CPU’s clock speed
rate is a measure of how many clock cycles a CPU can perform per second. For example, a CPU with a clock
rate of 1.8 GHz can perform 1,800,000,000 clock cycles per second.
It can be used to compare similar CPUs in the same family but it is not applicable for CPU`s of different
families. This may not seem obvious at first, but it is present because of difference in architecture.
Newer chips may perform operations faster, therefore it takes less clock cycles to perform then on another
chip.

It’s important to look not just at clock cycles but at the amount of work a CPU can do per clock cycle.
All other things being equal, fewer clock cycles with more work are better than more clock cycles with
less - fewer clock cycles means the CPU requires less power and produces less heat.

Modern CPUs aren`t fixed at a single speed. It runs at a slower speed when idle (or not doing much) and
a faster speed under load. he CPU dynamically increases and decreases its speed when needed. This should
be taken to consideration when choosing a new device. Maybe it may run only some time on it top speed
for overheating considerations, or it may only be able to run at its top speed for a certain amount of
time before running at a lower speed because it can’t be properly cooled.
On the other hand, a computer with the exact same CPU but better cooling may have better, more consistent
performance at top speeds if it can keep the CPU cool enough to run at those top speeds for longer.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    Cooling
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Almost every CPU uses a combination of a heat sink and fan assembly to wick heat away from the CPU.

Heat Sink. A copper or other metal device designed to dissipate heat from whatever it touches.
Before inserting the heat sink you need to add a small amount of thermal paste, note, you can have too
much thermal paste

Cooling options:
- OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) CPU coolers. Means that Inter/AMD sell you a CPU which comes
  already with sink+fan. You buy jsut the OAM CPU, meaning without cooling, from retailor but using original
  means that it 100% works.
- Specialized CPU coolers. Third-party heat sink and fan assemblies for a variety of CPUs.
  Usually, more eye catching design and higher efficiency.
  Opens more unusual options, like liquid cooling.

Note, in some instances you can create a system that has no fan for the CPU, what`s called fanless cooling.
Aside from mobile devices (like an Apple iPad) that have no fans, the term can be misleading. No fan can
mean using an alternative mechanism like ducts.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                  Overclocking
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In general overclocking stands for configuring CPU to run faster, but it may make your system less stable.
Almost all processors ship with a speed rating. For example, an Intel Core i7 860 runs at 2.80GHz out of
the box. Overclocking a Core i7 860 means pushing it to a clock speed higher than 2.80GHz.
The CPU won`t meld instantly since preconfigured speed is usually lower then maximall possible.

Overclocking will void the warranty of your retail CPU. Overclocking may destroy your CPU, your motherboard,
or your system memory. It may corrupt your hard drive. Be careful when overclocking. You have been warned.
Note, that extreme overclocking may require additional colling which may involve replacing of the old
mechanism.

All CPUs have a fundamental clock rate, from which all of the other clock rates inside the CPU are derived.
Various sections of the processor take this fundamental clock rate, which acts as a kind of standard
timekeeper, and multiply it to get an internal clock speed for a particular section of the CPU.
This clock rate is called the base clock or BCLK (usually 133MHz) for Intel Core i5/7 series of CPUs.
AMD calls this the CPU bus frequency (usually 200MHz).

Rated speed for i750 is 2.66 Ghz even though clock rate is 133MHz. The main processor takes the BLCK
number and multiplies it by CPU multiplier, which is 20 in this case, to get 2.66GHz. Some processor are
clock-locked meaning you can`t unlock the multiplier. This is useful tool to help with overclocking.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                     Issues
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CPU throttling (also known as dynamic clock or dynamic frequency scaling) is a mechanism that is
responsible for managing amount of resources used by CPU under differrent loads. This means, that if there
is no much load on CPU, there is no purpose to use all cores and spend resources like electirc charge.
This is done on devices like mobile phones to preserve battery when you don`t use device, increasing it`s
usage time.

Sometimes, you may face unwanted throttling. Current CPUs have a so high power density that if cooling
system fails, CPU will self-destruct. To prevent this, or if your fan just got blocked with dust, your
CPU will decrease it`s performance, possibly shut it down completely if the throttling doesn`t cool it
enough.
The same problem may be seen when there is lack of power. You need more power to up-clock a processor,
this is done by increasing frequency and voltage, and probably by engaging a fan. If you have problem
with power supply, your devince may run slower that it may run.

 Intel vs AMD
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is a question - why AMD is so popular even if Intel was one the first and biggest companyes.
In 1976, Intel couldn`t manufacture as many CPU`s as was requested by IBM, therefore they signed
cross-license agreement with AMD so they could preatty much clone Intel CPU`s without being sued.
When Intel got big and didn`t want the AMD still producing the CPUs - they could as the result of license
agreement. In January 1995, they have settled and decided to end the licensing agreements. As a result of
this, AMD chops are no longer compatible with sockets or motherboards made for Intel CPUs. If you want to
use an Intel CPU

=========================================================================================================
                                  Peripherals
=========================================================================================================
There are plenty of peripheral devices needed for comfort work with computer, such as mouse and keyboard.
To controll them and send/receive command they need to be connected to the CPU. The simplest way is just
to extend data/address bus through the motherboard, connecting all of the computer`s conntollers to the
CPU. Therefore, ealy motherboards where coverd in controller chips.

Over time, multiple contollers were packerd into specifically designed chipsets. Early chipsets consisted
of two paired chops called the northbridge and southbridge.

Today`s CPUs have controllers, such as the memory and display controllers, built in. Other are packed into
a single chip called Platform Controller Hub by Intel and just chipset by others.
The chipset extends the data bus to every device on the PC.

Note, the CPU doesn`t know how to automatically talk with any device; it needs some support program loaded
into memory that teaches it about a particular device. The BIOS (Basic Input/Output services) is a program
that loads other programs dedicated to teaching CPU to communicate with devices and these are called
services (or device drivers).

Having BIOS creates a new set of probles. The main one is where to store all those programs for device
communication. Possible solution is to keep it withing OS, which is fine when OS already installed on the
device and is up running. But what to do when new system is built and there is not OS installed yet.
You still need to have access to display and the keyboard so you can do at least something. These can
be on the harddrive but where do we store the driver for that hardrive or it is not present at all. 
The perfect place to store them is on the motherboard but type of memory is under a question. Some form of
RAM is not valid, since it will loose all data on the reset. It should be peprmanent that does not depend
on other peripherals to work and that needs to sit on the board. 

ROM (Read Only Memory) chip is the solution to the previous problem.
Motherboards use a type of ROM called flash ROM. Such chip is called the system ROM chop because it
contains code that enables your CPU to talk to the basic hardware of your PC. All the utilities stored on
the system ROM chip are called, collectively, the system BIOS or firmware since it is directly stored
on the hardware ROM.

This approche works fine for devices that are always present and never change like a keyboard but things
get ore complicated when you want to change something in your device, like add more RAM or change hard.
In this case, you would hold additional drivers on a harddrive which would be loaded on a boot.
Modern systems use firmware grogramming called the UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) instead
of BIOS.

All of the BIOS setting are saved to a tiny bit of RAM hooked up to a small battery to keep it
working with the PC off, called CMOS. In addition to BIOS settings it holds an RTC value.
The information stored in CMOS is necessary for the PC to function. If the data stored in CMOS about a
piece of hardware is different from the specs of the actual hardware, the computer cannot access that
piece of hardware.
Note, MacOS machines are usually designed form the ground up as unified systems so there is not much
flexebility in changing however you have less headache with CMOS configuration.

To modify CMOS, every PC ships with a system setup utility built into the system ROM. These look different
from vendor to vendor but all contain basically the same settings. The latest ones even support mouse
usage.

                                      PCI
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- PCI (Peripheral Component Interconnect). Common connection interface for attaching computer peripherals
  to a PC`s motherboard. This interface was popular between 1995 and 2005 and now is changed for PCIe.
  Some PCI can be present on motherboard for backward compatibility, but the devices that used to be
  attached as PCI expansion cards are now either integrated onto motherboards or attached by other
  connectors like PCIe.
  One of the reasons behind it`s popularity was that Intel released PCI to the public domain.
  Another is the capability to coexist with other expansion buses so you could buy a motherboard with
  both old slots and a new PCI, therefore slowly migrating to the PCI
- Mini PCI. Laptops variant of PCI, designed to use low power and to lie flat.
- PCI Express, PCIe. The same PCI but it uses a point-to-point serial connection instead of PCI`s shared
  parallel communication. It is more easy to use in high speed cases as well it is not shared by all devices
  instead each one has a separate connection to the CPU.
  
Transfer rate. The number of operations happening per second.
PCI uses one wire for sending and one for receiving, such pair is called a lane.
Each ptp connection can use 1,2,4,8,12,16 lanes to achive a max theoretical bandwidth of up to 256 GTps.
PCIe has following speed per lane
    1.x | 2.5 GTps
    2.x | 5   GTps
    3.x | 8   GTps
    4.0 | 16  GTps

The most common PCIe slot is the 16-lane (x16) version most often used for video cards.

                                  Power Suply
=========================================================================================================
Electricity works essentially the same way as water through pipes. Electric companies gather or generate
electricity and then push it to your house under pressure through wires.

Voltages. Measure of the electrons pressure in the wire, measured in volts.
Current/Amperage. The amount of electrons moving past a certain point on a wire, measured in amperes.
Wattage. The amps and volts needed so that a particular device will function. 
 V | Presure, voltage
 A | Volume, ampers
 W | Work, wattage
 Q | Resistence, ohms
 W = V x A

The voltage from the power supply tends to sag (drop well below) and surge/spike the standard. These sags
and spikes usually don`t affect lamps and refrigeratos but they can keep your PC from running or can even
destroy a PC or peripheral device. Spikes can be handled at the supply of AC using surge suppressors and
uninterruptible power supplies.

Surge Supperssors. Any surge can harm your computer, and a strong can destroy components, therefore, every
PC should use a surge suppressor device that absorbs the extra voltage from a surge to protect the PC.
The power supply may handle small surges but it takes a lot of damage from this and will eventually fail.
To protect your power supplu, a dedicated surge suppressor works between the power supply and the outlet
to protect the system from power surges. Note, they have grades and you need to research before buying.

UPS. Uninterruptible Power Supply.Contains a big battery that provides AC power to your computer regardless
of the power coming from the AC outlet.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                   Connectors
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mother boards use 20/24 pin P1 power connectors, some may require special 4/6/8 pin connectors to supply
extra power. 

The typical PC power supply has at least three types of connectors that plug into peripherals:
- Molex. Supplies 5/12-V current for fans and older drives. Require a firm push to plug in properly, and
  a strong person can defeat the chamfers (notches) plugging a Molex in uppside down. Always check for
  proper orientation before you push it in.
- Mini. A few power supplies still support it.
- SATA. Serial ATA drives need a 15pin SATA power connector. The large pin count supports the SATA
  hot-swappable feature and 3.3/5/12 V devices.
Another connectors include:
- PCIe 6/8pin connector. Higher-end video cards have one or two sockets that require specific 6/8pin
  PCIr power connectors.

ATX power supplies.
Had two distinguishing physical features: the motherboard power connector and soft power.
Motherboard power came from a single cable with a 20pin P1 motherboard power connector.
Also had at least two other cables each populated with two or more Molex or mini connectors for peripheral
power.

Rails. AC is conerted to DC by the power supply into three main voltage rails: 3.3/5/12V and groups of
wires run from each of these voltage rails to the various connectors. Each rail has a maximum amount of
power it can supply which is usually quite above needed for simple PC but can be not enough for some high
end ones. The most popular solution is to include multiple rails in the power supply and an OCP (over
current protection) which prevents overusage of the single rail.


Splitters. If you don`t have enough connectors to power all of the devices inside your PC, you can use
spllitiers to create more connections.

Adapters. You may need a SATA connectors but having only a spare Molex. Because the voltages on the wires
are the same, a simple adapter will take of the problem.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    Cooling
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fans sizes are measured in millimeters (mm) or centimeters (cm). Traditionally, the industry used 80mm
power supply and cooling fans, but today you`ll find 100/120mm and even larger fans in power supplies and
cases.

TODO: sleeve-bearing vs ball-bearing fans.
=========================================================================================================
                                     Busses
=========================================================================================================
The relation of the different busses is roughly as follows:
                                              / SATA
CPU => Northbridge => PCI Bus => Southbridge => IDE
                                              \ USB

Northbridge and Southbridge are two main controller chips inside a PC.  They are bridges because USB/IDE/...
packets are forwarded through them to CPU. Packet like USB are encapsulated into PCI packets and sent do CPU.

IDE and SATA perform the same job but through differebt physical media, they are fore attaching hard drives etc.

IDE ("Integrated Device Electronics") => also known as "ATA" or "ATAPI"(ATA Peripheral Intreface)
Parallel bus used primarily inside computers to communicate with disk drives.

SATA (Serial ATA) => the same ATA protocol but serial instead of parallel It is high speed serial replacement
for IDE, uses a lot fewer wires

USB is a serial communications bus which can communicate with any number of devices, not just hard drives
and other storage devices. It speaks a completely different protocol to the ATA family.

PCI (and the derivatives PCIe, etc) are much closer to the CPU and generally provides much more direct
access to the CPU.

                                   Video card
=========================================================================================================
The display adapter, or video card, processes information for the CPU and sending it to othe display.
Although many new systems have the display adapter circuity built into the CPU and motherboard, it is still
commonly refered to as video card, since intial computers had no video support, and you would use expansion
video card.
Video card is defined by five aspects: motherboard slot, graphics processor, video memory, integrated GPUs
and connections.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Motherboard slot
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are four main ways that display adapters connecct to a motherboard:
- PCI. Not used any more. Limited to 32bit transfers at roughly 33MHz makeing maximum bandwidth of 132MBps.
  Almost every system had more than one PCI device, each requiring part of that bandwidth.
- AGP. Not used any more. Intel has developed a separate port, similar to a PCI slot, dedicated to video.
  No motherboard had 2 AGP slots and you`ll encounter these on ancient systems only.
- PCIe. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 GPU. Graphical Processing Unit
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The GPU takes commands from the CPU and translates them into coordinates and color information that the
monitor understands and displays.
Many companies make the hundreds of different video cards on the market, but only three companies produce
the vast majority of graphics processors found on video cards: NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel.
NVIDIA and AMD make and sell GPUs to third-party manufacturers who then design, build, and sell video cards
under their own branding. Intel contrates on GPUs built into motherboards.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Video Memory
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When you`re working with heavy-duty apps, video memory can prove to be a serious bottleneck in three ways:
data throughput speed, access speed, and simple capacity.
- Video display memory uses a wider bus

The main difference between DRAM and VRAM is that it can both write and read data at the same time.
The most common type of such VRAM is GDDR5+, although DDR3 is still the most popular memory on low-end
non-gaming cards. 
HBM2 (High Bandwidth Memory V2) offers a different stly of memory by using stacked DRAM connected via
super-wide buses, for instance: GDDR has a 32-bit bus, while HBM supports 1024-bit bus.
It is common to have 8-24GB of VRAM used for games.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Integrated GPUs
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some motherboards have Integrated GPU, and quite a few can support a CPU with an integrated GPU.

=========================================================================================================
                                 Video Displays
=========================================================================================================
Video displays come in three varieties: flat-panel monitors, projectors, virtual reality headsets.
Almost every computing device today uses a LCD panel as the primary visual output component.

Modern LCD(Liquid Crystal Display) monitors are extremely thin, as if they are made out of a single piece
of material. They are, however, made up of multiple components including the display panel.
The display panel is a flat sheet of material that contains liquid crystals that react in different ways
when electricity is applied.


Monitors have many of characteristics like: panel type, screen size, refresh rate, response time, etc...
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                  Display Panel Types
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Monitor panel technology affects what the monitor can do and for which uses it is best suited. There are
4 main panel types called: IPS, TN, VA, OLED. All of them are part of the LCD panel technology family.
The specific type of LCD panel affects many different aspects of screen performance including:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Response time and input lag:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Response time is a measure of how quickly a pixel can display a change from either black to white or
between shadows of gray. Different shades of gray represent how intense any given color will appear on
your monitor through a filter.
It is specified by display manufacturers but only for monitors, not for TVs since it has no purpose to
have a high response time.
It is measured in milliseconds since on a standart 60Hz minitor there is under seventeen milliseconds
to display a frame. Therefore, pixels need to transition more quickly than that so they can display the
next frame in time.
A longer response time results in `ghosting`, when you can see the remain of trails from a movin object
on a screen because pixels took too long to switch between shades of gray. This affects gamers for whom
the poor response times can cause distracting visual artifacts. This can be seen when you move mouse
pointer withing your monitor.
Panel type  | Respone Time | Comment
TN          |     1ms      |
IPS         |    4/5ms     |
VA          |    4/5ms     | Takes more time to change from deep black shades
OLED        |    0.1ms     | There are no OLED monitors except for a few very expesive aimed at high-end
            |              | professional designers
Note, it may take more time to change pixel from white to black but less to some shade of black. It is
commonly used marketting trick to say time used to move from white to shade of black.

Input lag is the delay between a keystroke or mouse click and the result happening on the screen. It is
a time between GPU sending data to monitor and data being displayed. The problem is a high number of
standarts used by manufactures, bad testing methologies and not the most humble values provided. As well,
input lag depends on different variables like server lag.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Viewing angle:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The higher the viewing angle, the better people who look at the monitor from the side will be able to see
its display.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Color reproduction:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The reproduction of the colors of an original on a picture, photograph, motion-picture screen, television
screen. Color distortions that arise during the process of reproduction are unavoidable. It is determined
by a color gamut (range/plane/set of colors). In order to quantify how much color a device can handle, it
uses one of the standardized colopr gamuts that define a particular range of color. The most common of the
RGB based color gamuts is sRGB, typical gamut used for all computer displays. It is one of the oldest and
therefore narrowest of the color gamuts that is used 
Another examples of gamut are AdobeRGB developed by Adobe as a color gamut to provide a wider range of
colors than sRGB; NTSC was the color space developed for the range of colors that can be represented to
the human eye. It is also the only representative of the perceived colors that humans can see and is not
actually the widest color gamut possible; CIE 1976 gamut used by LCD monitors.
So, to quantify the various color gamuts in terms of their relative range of color of narrowest to widest
would be CIE 1976 < sRGB < AdobeRGB < NTSC.

Monitors are generally rated on their color by the percentage of colors out of a color gamut that are possible.
Thus, a monitor that is rated at 100% NTSC can display all of the colors within the NTSC color gamut. A screen
with a 50% NTSC color gamut can only represent half of those colors.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Contrast ratio:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Contrast ration describes the difference between the brightest white and the darkest black the LCD monitor
can disaply. Higher contrast ratios equal whiter whites and blacker blacks, as well as a greater degree of
gray values in between. The best contrast ratio you can get is 1,000 : 1.
Note, different vendors may use different means for measurement, therefore, you can`t compare the values
between different vendors.

https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/7-important-buying-lcd-computer-monitor/
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brightness:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LCD monitors are illuminated by several backlights. Brightness is measured in candelas per square meter
(cd/m2) or nits?. A higher rating of at least 300 cd/m2, i.e. higher brightness, is to be desired if you
want to watch movies or play games on your computer. For office work and browsing a lower rating of
200 - 250 cd/m2 is fine.

One candela is roughly equal to the amount of light created by a candle.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ports:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You need to connect monitor to computer video card. This is done with some type of port like DisplayPort.
You should check if your GPU and monitor have common ports, otherwise you may need a convertor which
may degrade speed to data translation.
The commonly used ports:
1. Display port. The latest digital display interface, produced since 2008.
2. HDMI. High-Definition Multimedia Interface, a digital audio/video interface produced since 2003.
3, DVI. Digital Video Interface, the first digital video interface. Produced to replace VGA since 1999.
4. VGA. Video Graphics Array, the old analog connector, first produced in 1987.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Black levels:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Black level is defined as the level of brightness at the darkest (black) part of a visual image or the
level of brightness at which no light is emitted from a screen, resulting in a pure black screen. 
The black level  helps to determine the level of picture quality. Generally, the darker the black level,
the better the quality of the visuals.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dot Pitch:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A measurement that indicates the vertical distance between each pixel on a display screen. It is measured
in millimeter. The dot pitch is one of the principle characteristics that determine the quality of display
monitors.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DPI/PPI:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pixels are physical points on display used to display some coler at a moment. Monitor has thouthands to
millions of them and the more there is the higher picture quality you may get.
Pixels are usually measured in terms of density, e.g. how many you have per area of monitor. Usually
area is a inch by inch sized square and its measurement is called DPI(Dots Per Inch) or PPI (Pixels Per Inch).
A higher pixel density will mean that there are more pixels packed into every square inch of your screen.

Here is a example of case where DPI is applicable:
You have two monitors, both Full HD 1080p resolution but one is 32-inch screen, whileother is a 25-inch
screen. Here, 25inch screen will have higher DPI, resulting in smoother lines and sharper images.
However, at some point, density gets so high that human eye can see no difference, this depends on
individual.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Refresh rate:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A refresh rate is the number of times your monitor updates with new images each second. For example,
a 60 Hz refresh rate means the display updates 60 times per second. A higher refresh rate results in a
smoother picture.
To use all frames refreshed by display you need to have a strong enough computer. If you have an 120Hz
monitor but game runs on 60fps, there will be no new information between each second frame therefore it
will look like the same. Therefore there may be no purpose to bye top tier 240Hz monitor to play a
60fps game. As well, it makes some tradeoffs to design such monitor, for instance: display type will be
a TN to support a high refresh rate and such monitors have problems with view angle and color quality.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnKGTZIAup0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Convergence:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It refers to how sharply an individual colour pixel on a monitor appears. Each pixel is composed of three
dots namely a red, a green and a blue. If the dots are badly mis converged, the pixel will appear blurry.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VESE Mounts:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Almost every monitor these days has a standardized bracket option for mounting the monitor on the wall or
on a special stand called a VESA mount. VESA mount standards have a couple of official names:
FDMI (Flat Display Mounting Interface) and the MIS (VESA Mounting Interface Standard).

Curved panels do not have VESA mount options.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IPS `In-Plane Switching`
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IPS monitors or “In-Plane Switching” monitors, leverage liquid crystals aligned in parallel to produce
rich colors.
+ Better viewing angles. Crystal's has an ability to shift horizontally creating better viewing angles.
  Collor won`t ve shifter when being viewed at an angle as drastically as they do on a TN monitor.
+ High color accuracy. They support professional color space technologies, such as Adobe RGB.
  IPS monitors are able to offer more displayable colors, which help improve color accuracy.
- Higher response time and contrast. However, they have quite advanced to the point they are capable
  of satisfy gamers. Slower respones time may result in visible motion blur.
- Below average static contrast ratio
- Potential white glow from off-angles when viewing dark content. Usually only an issue with lower-end
  & off-brand IPS monitors

IPS monitor variations include S-IPS, H-IPS, e-IPS and P-IPS and PLS (Plane-to-Line Switching), the
latter being the latest iteration.  Since these variations are all quite similar, they are all collectively
referred to as “IPS-type” panels.

Main users of IPS monitors are graphical designers, CAD engineers, pro photographers and video editors.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TN `Twisted Nematic`
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is the oldest LCD panel type, which is cheaper then IPS and VA and are popular mainstream display
technology for desktop and laptop displays. Such monitors are preferred by competitive gamers for its
rapid response time and the fastest refresh rates on the market. However they can`t display as wide a
range of color as some other technologies and the formation of the crystals causes issues when you
attempt to view the display from an off angle.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VA `Vertical Alignment`
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Has a higher static contrast ration providing truly black colors and the brightest whites.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                   Resolution
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Monitor resolution describes the visual dimensions of display in terms of relation of width and height.
Example of a resoultion is well known Full HD 1080p meaning that display is 1920 (width) x 1080 (height)
pixels, resulting in a grand total of 2.073.600 pixels on screen.

The higher monitor resolution is, the more detailed an image can be since it has more pixels to use.
This will of course depend on the resolution of the content you are viewing but this may require stronger
device to maintain smoothe picture.

There are following, common, monitor resolutions:
1. 720p. HD, HD Ready, Standart HD. 1280x720
2. 1080p. Full HD, FHD. 1920x1080
3. 1440p. 2K, WQHD, QHD. 2560x1440
   Known as `Quad HD`, it is 4 times stronger? than the base HD variant.
   Is not widespread but can be found within computers and smartphones.
4. 4K, UHD, Ultra HD, 4K UHD. 3840x2160
   Named so because has 4 times more pixels than HD.
5. 8K, 8K UHD. 7680x4320
   The highest monitor resolution currently available.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                 Aspect Ration
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The monitor aspect ration is the correlation of horizontal to vertical pixels in a display.
There are following ratios:
1. 4:3 ratio, also know as fullscreen
2. 16:9 ratio, also know as widescreen.
3. 21:9 ratio, 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                     Issues
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Screen flickering. It is an issue when picture is not draw proparly resulting in multiple parts from
different screnn updates to be displayed. This may look like part of screen filled with random pixels
and not refreshed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh-7-6Yb0Oc

Screen tearing. It is an visual artifact when multiple frames are merged and displayed at once. It is the
result of creating frames at higher rate then screen may display. Usually you monitor has like 60Mhz
refresh rate, meaning it displays 60 pictures a second, however your game may run at 120fps, meaning
120 pictures per second. Tear line may at fixed location or move across screen depending if unsync
time changes or not.

This may be fixed with V-sync (Vertical synchronization), which prevents video card from doing anything
visible to the display memory until after the monitor finishes it current refresh cycle. This will
prevent the 2 devices every falling out of sync, at the expense of higher latency.

There is new technology called G-Sync. It provides support for dynamic refresh rate which is negotiated
by video card and display. Note that not all monitors support G-Sync. It is a Nvidia implementation
requiring a compatible Nvidia graphics card. Other vendors provide it`s own implementation like FreeSync
from AMD.
Difference between FreeSync and Gsync is following. Gsync work with monitors refresh rate up to 240 Hz
and to 144Hz when using 4K display. FreeSync works up to 120MHz for 4K but there are FreeSync TVs on
market, meaning you can connect TV to your PC ?. As well Nvidia graphical cards supportying Gsync comes
in two forms, one without its support and another more expensive with support, while AMD has FreeSync
bult in.

These technologies are a big improvement for gaming, but there`s a downside: minimal cross-compatibility.
To take advantage of adaptive sync, you GPU and monitor either both need to support FreeSync/G-Sync.
Although, Nvidia announced support for a handful of FreeSync monitors.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                               Ultrawide monitors
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ultrawide monitors are monitors that utilize a 21:9 aspect ratio rather than the traditional monitor screen
ratio of 16:9.

Reasons to use ultrawide monitor instead of two monitors:
1. No (bezel) gap between screens.
2. Cinamtic aspect ration lets you to watch films in their native resolution. To dispaly film on
   traditional display, video is scalled down untill it fits the wids. This creates a black line on top
   and bottom of the screen called letterboxing.
3. Color consistency. If you are a professional designer of something like that, then it is important for
   you to have the best quality of colors. This may be a problem on dual monitor setup since even when you
   have the same two monitors, they may display colors differently. There is no such problem on one big
   monitor.
4. Configuration consistency. You don`t need to keep setting between monitors synced.
5. Curved immersion. There are curved variants that create a feeling of immersion.

                                    Mounting
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VESA. Video Electronics Standards Association. Nealry universally accepted standard for mounting monitors
to monitor arms (or other applications and surfaces). Monitor being VESA compatible can be mounted for a
range of arms. The back of your monitor should have four screwholes either 75mm or 100mm ... apart.
When choosing the arm, you should take to consideration the following metrics:
- Mounting method
  Edge Clamp. Attaches the monitor arm to any edge of the desk, this method gives you more distance
  Grommet Mounting. Allows to mount the arm through the grommet hole in your desk top
      Note, some arms may support both of these methods
  Free Standing
  Wall or celling
- Lift Mechanism. Arms hold up their loads using either a spring or gas lift mechanism.
  Spring    | Has the longest lifetime and is more economical
  Gas       | Provide smoother response to movement
  Electric  | Can change heights by simply pushing a button
- VESA Mount holes spacing
- Number of monitors used
- Size of the monitors, will they fit all at once
- Weight of the monitors
- How often do the screen need to be adjusted
  Horizontally left&right, Forward/Back, Screen Tilt, Vertically, Depth adjustment
- Is your setup agains the wall

Keyboard types:
1. Membrane. There is a rubber membrane under each key which closes the contact on the typing plate. These
   keyboards are easy to make, hence thir low price. Such keyboards tend to lag on press. The issue is in

Keys material plastic:
1. ABS-plastic
   It costs much
   Doesn`t rub off, no unpleasant gloss appears in due course
   It has increased temperature resistance (up to 300* F) and strength
2. PBT-plastic
   It is cheap and light
   the characters can get erased and the keyboard becomes glossy
   Will melt after a few hours in the sun

Assuming that you are choosing a mechanical model, there are still a few more things you should know.
Beneath each key, there`s a physical switch that registers a keystroke. There are dozens of mechanical
switch types and manufacturers, and keeping them all straight can be difficult.
- Cherry MX. Industry-standard. They come in a variety of colors, the most common are Red, Brown, and Blue
  Red keys are quite and respond to a soft-touch
  Brown keys are quiet but resistant
  Blue keys are clackety and resistant
  Black keys are shallow and stiff
  Greens are louder and more resistant than Blues

Illumination. When it comes to backlighting, there are generally three choices in keyboards: none, one
color, or full RGB.

Key Rollover. How many keypresses your keyboard can register at once. Most standard keyboards offer 1- or
2-Key Rollover (1/2KRO). Press more than that at once, and the additional keystrokes either won’t register,
or your keyboard will register additional unpressed keys. This is an issue more commonly known as "ghosting."
To avoid ghosting, quality gaming keyboards come with a minimum 6-Key Rollover.

Form Factor. 
- A full-size board has all the keys you need to operate a computer without worrying about any function
  layers. There’s a full number pad as well.The main drawback of this size is that it’s rather large and
  inefficient.
- Tenkeyless. TKL. Sometimes known as 80 percent keyboards. These boards still don’t rely on function
  layers for basic features, but there’s no number pad. 
- 60% boards. A 60 percent board just has the alphas, number row, and modifiers. There are no dedicated
  arrow keys, no F-row, and no number pad. All those features are there, but they’re in the function layer.
  So, you hold function and press a different key.
- Exotic layouts.
- Super small 40 percent category. These boards have just alpha keys and a few modifiers.
  They’re essentially pocket size and usually have at least two function-key layers to get all the basic
  keyboard commands covered.

=========================================================================================================
DPI. Dots per inch. Measurement of how sensitive a mouse is. The higher a mouse’s DPI, the farther the
cursor on your screen will move when you move the mouse. For example, if your mouse has 1600 DPI, then
moving it exactly one inch (2.54 cm) will move the cursor 1600 pixels on your screen. A mouse with a higher
DPI setting detects and reacts to smaller movements.

Polling rate. How often it reports its position to a computer. Polling rate is measured in Hz. If a mouse
has a 125 Hz polling rate, it reports its position to the computer 125 times every second—or every 8
milliseconds. A 500 Hz rate means that the mouse is reporting its position to the computer every 2
milliseconds.

If you’re planning to play at 1080p you will want to get a graphics card with at least 3GB of memory, but
4GB would be ideal. For gaming at higher resolutions like 1440p or 4K you should get a card with 8GB or
more memory.

Check the dimensions of the graphics card so you can make sure that there is room in the case for your GPU.
Some graphics cards will also use more expansion slots (most GPUs take two slots), so if you are also buying
a sound card make sure there is room for it on the motherboard and in the case.

Power supply
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When you are buying a GPU, you will need to check the power consumption and based on what your card needs
you will know what power supply you will buy. For example, if your GPU needs 200W and your CPU 150W then
you want to buy a PSU with 500W or if you want to play extra safe 600W. You also want to check if your PSU
has the power connectors to power your GPU because some cards use two eight-pin connectors, some two six-pin
and some combine six and eight-pin connectors. If your PSU doesn’t have the connectors that the GPU needs,
you threw your money away for nothing.

                              Graphics card vs GPU
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Graphics card is the piece of hardware that is responsible of producing output to monitor. It has a connector(s)
for monitor(s) and another connector to computer motherboard. Graphics card has its own memorymodules and
most importantly the graphics processing unit that actually creates the display we see on monitor screen.
Modern graphics cards also have power input connectors and their own cooling solutions.

GPU is short from Graphics Processing Unit. It is specially designed processor to most effectively process
the displaying needs of a working computer. GPU is an integral part of a graphics card.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AA is a term used to describe the software process of making edges of graphics objects or fonts smoother
by removing staircase effect. Accomplished by adding additional pixels in-between the edges of an object
and its background. There is different forms of AA like: MSAA(Multi-Sample Anti-Aliasing), FXAA (Fast
Approximate Anti Aliasing), TXAA (Temporal Anti Aliasing), EQAA

                                 Integrated GPU
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A dedicated graphics card is a piece of hardware used to manage the graphics performance of a computer.
They’re sometimes also called video cards or discrete graphics.

Integrated graphics refers to a computer where the graphics processing unit (GPU) is built onto the same
die as the CPU. This comes with several benefits. It’s small, energy efficient, and is less expensive than
a dedicated graphics card. However, most of the time it is much slower.

Note that integrated graphics shares memory with the main system memory. You’ll sometimes see it described
as shared graphics for this reason. If your computer has 4GB of RAM and 1GB of shared graphics memory,
you’d only have 3GB of memory available for general computing tasks.

There are different forms like full tower, micro tower, cube, but what`s most important is findinf a case
that`s compatible with yout motherboard size. Once you've identified what type of motherboard mount you
need, take a look at exactly what hardware you're going to put inside it. Some GPU may take allot of space
and even large mid-tower cases can restrict the length of GPU you can use, or require to remove drive
bays to do so.

                                   Drive bay
=========================================================================================================
Drive bay refers to a site in a PC where a hard or floppy disk drive, CD-ROM drive or tape drive can be
installed. Thus, the number of drive bays in a computer determines how many mass storage devices can be
internally installed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                Metrics
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Size. For PCs, bays come in two basic sizes: 3.5-inch and 5.25-inch, which represents the bay's height.
- Place. Bays are described as either internal or exposed. An internal bay cannot be used for removable
  media, such as floppy drives. Some manufacturers use the terms hidden and accessible in place of internal
  and exposed.

                                  Motherboard
=========================================================================================================
Motherborad is the main printed circuit board present in the computers which holds the main electronic
components of the system like the central processing unit and memory, also provides the connectors for
other important peripherals and the CPU chip.

Alternatively referred to as the mb, mainboard, mobo, mobd, backplane board, base board, planar board,
system board, logic board on Apple computers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    Metrics
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Types.  AT, ATX, LPX, BTX, Pico BTX, Mini ITX 
2. Form factor. The physical size, as well as the general location of components and ports.
   Industry-standardized shapes and layouts that enable motherboards to work with cases and power supplies.
 - AT. Obsolete, was poplar though the mid 1990s. At that point, there was no peripheral devices except
   display and keyboard, therefore it lacked ports with appearence of new deivces like mouse.
 - ATX (Extended?). Distincts from AT in the lack of keyboard port, replaced with a rear panel that has
   all necessary ports built in. Had better sizes and placement for air movement; placed the RAM closer to
   the northbridge and CPU offer users enhanced performance.
 - ITX. Wasn`t a success, developing company created MicroATX after this
 - MicroATX and FlexATX small variants of ATX
 - Proprietary Form Factor. Several major PC makers made motherboards that worked only with their cases.
   Such systems would stood out to the public. These may include riser cards, a board that plugs into the
   motherborad and provides additional slots for adapter cards. Called like this because it rises above the
   system board.
3. Chipset. Defines the type of processor and RAM, determines to a degree the built-in devices the
   motherboard supports, including the expansion slots.
4. Standart Components. Socket or two for CPU, slots for RAM, ports for mass storage devices and so on.
 - USB ports
 - Sound card
 - Networking interfaces
 - Video ports for attaching a display
 - RAID
 - Case fan support. CPU fan power connector, usually a four-wire connector, may supports three-wire fans.
   Note, fans can be connected to motherboard or a power supply, in the former case you will have a
   programatic access to the fan from OS. 
 - Expansion Bus.
5. Additional Components. The connection and capabilities of a motherboard sometimes differ from those of
   the chipset, in case when not all chipset feates are needed or new conviniat features are added.
   To support these new features, motherboard manufacturers put additional chips on the board.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            Components and functions
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Processor Socket. Central picece of a motherbroard, holding the processor, usually located near the center
of the motherbroard.
4 pin CPU Fan pin-out for CPU fans with higher power consumption.

Power Connectors. Commonly 20/24 pin connector, situated either near the right edge of the motherboard, or
somewhere close to the processor socket on older motherboards. Power supply, connected here, will provide
power to the motherboard and all the other components.
On newer motherboards, there may be an additional 4/8 bin connector near the processor, used to supply
additional power directly to the processor.

Memory Slots. Slots used to connect memory modules. Number of slots can vary from 2, in low-end motherboards,
up to 8, on high-end and gaming motherboards. Check type of memory supported by a motherboard before buying
one.

CMOS (Complimentary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) battery and RAM. 
RAM is used to store basic information about the PC`s configuration to avoide reconfiguration or reset.
Some of possible information:
- Disk types
- Information abot CPU
- RAM size
- Date and time updated by RTC (Real Time Clock)
- Serial and parallel port information
- PnP information
- Power Saving settings

L3+ Cache memory.
Most modern CPUs have an internal 2 layer cache memory (built into the processor) which is referred to as
primary cache memory. This can be supplemented by external cache memory fitted on the motherboard, called
L3 or secondary cache.

Expansion Bus.
I/O pathways from the CPU to peripherals, typically made up of a series of slots on the motherboard.
Examples of buses are PCI, ISA, EISA.

Chip-sets.
A group of small circuits that coordinate the flow of data to and from a PC`s key components.
These components include: CPU, RAM, Cache and devices situated on the buses.
Also controls data flow to and from hard disksk and other devices connected to the IDE channels.
A computer has 2 main chipsets:
# Bridge - component which connects two buses
- NorthBridge (memory controller). In charge of controlling transfers between the processor and the RAM.
  It is located near the processor. Sometimes, called GMCH for Graphic and Memory Controller Hub.
- SouthBridge (IO/expansion controller). Handles communication between slower peripheral devices. 
  Also called ICH for IO Controller Hub.h

CPU Clock.
Clock synchronizing the operation of all parts of the PC and provides the basic timing signal for the CPU.
Note, cpu clock speer is measured by multiplying system clock speed with some clock multiplier, for instance,
system bus runs at 100MHz speed but the CPU handles multiplier upto 32 making possible 3.2GHz.

                                Storage Devices
=========================================================================================================
Computer needs some device where it can save or remember any settings or information. This type of devices
is called storage devices, also refered as digital storage, storage, storage media/medium. It is an
hardware device capable of holding information either temporarily or permanently. 

Storages used with computer =>
1. Primary storage, like RAM
2. Secondary storage, such as hard drive. It can be removeable, internal or external
3. Off-line storage. CD-RW, USB and Tape drives...
4. Tertiary storage

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              Storage Technologies
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are three kinds of storage technologies used
1. Magnetic Storage. Data is encoded in patterns of positive and negative magnetic polarity on some magnetic
   medium like organic metal. Devices like floppy disks, tape recorder cassettes and Hard disks are using
   magnetic storage technology.
2. Optical Storage. Laser/optical reflection phenomenon is used to read/write data. Two things are required,
   optical media (circular discs) and optical drives whice have the laser beam source for lightening and
   the photo diodes generating the voltages patterns when the reflection beam hit on these. There are
   three tipes of Discs using nowadays: CD (Compact Disc), DVD (Digital versatile Disc), BD (Blue-Ray Disc).
3. Solid State storage, Nonvolatile (or flash) memory that can retain data when power is off. This technology
   has no moving parts. Storage is more expensive but is lighter, faster, quiter, and more efficient then
   previous ones. Most common forms are: USB flash drive, flash memory cards (used in digital cameras,
   smartphones...), flash hard drives also called solid state drives (SSDs) 

HDDD/SSHD (Hybrid Hard Drives). Drives that combine flash memory and spinning platters to provide fast and
reliable storage.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    Metrics
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Spindle speed. Hard drives run at a set speed measured in RPM (Revolutions Per Minute).
  Older drives - 3600 RPM, common 5400/7200 RPM, high end 10000/15000 RPM.
  Higher speed generally equate better performance, as well more noise and heat. Excess hear cuts the life
  of HDD dramatically.
  Drive bay fan. Fan that sits at the front of a bay and blow air across the drive, some cases come with a
  bay fan built in.
  Booting up a computer with an HDD takes time because it needs to spin up before the read/write heads can
  retricve data off the drive and load it into RAM. SSDs use flash memory chips to store data instead of all
  metal spinning parts used in platter-based hard drives.
- Form factors. HDDs are manufactured in two standartized form factors, 2.5inch and 3.5inch.
  Desktop can use both, but laptops use 2.5inch one. Size doesn`t affect technology inside and connections.
  SSD come in one of three form factors: 2.5inch mSATA and M.2 which connects to specific slots on
  motherboard. Many current motherboards offer two or more M.2 slots.
- Cost. SSDs cost more than HDDs. Less expensive SSDs typically implement less reliable MLC.

Performance. Questions asked:
How fast it can read/write long sequences of data stored in the same part of the drive.
How fast it cat read/write small chunks of data scatered randomly around the drive.
How quickly it responds to a single request.
- Throughput. Sequential Read/Write Performance. MBps
  HDD: top out at 200MBps
  SSD: SATA SSDs can hit 600MBps and NVMe roll at 2500MBps or faster.
- Mixed random performance. How many times/sec a device can read/write small, fixed-size chunks of data
  at random locations on the drive. Measured in IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second) but can be
  expressed in MBps.
  HDD: typically clock in at fewer than 150 IOPS
  SSD: the latest NVMe SSDs hundreds of thousands of IOPS
- Response/Acess time, Latency. How quickly it responds to a single request. Expressed in ms/us
  HDD: under 20ms
  SSD: under 1ms

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                                   Standards
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
There must be an standart that specifies how the CPU communicates with hard drive so you can connect any
hardrive to you CPU and address it`s memory.
ATA (Advanced Technology Attachment). Standards started in 1990, goint through ATA/ATAPI version 7.
The original ATA defined a very specific series of commands for the CPU to communicate with the drive
controller. The current drive command  sets are AHCI and NVMe, the SCSI is still around as well.
We are interested in two version of the standard: PATA and SATA. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  SATA vs PATA
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Parallel ATA (PATA) was introduced with ATA/ATAPI version 1. Used 40-pin ribbon cables usually plugged
directly into motherboard. All PATA drives used a standard Molex power connectors.
A single PATA ribbon cable could connect up to two PATA drives to a single ATA controller, one being
master and other slaves, configured with jumpers.
S.M.A.R.T (Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology), an internal driver program that tracks
errors and error conditions withing the drive. It is stored internally on non volatile memory and can
be read with reader software.
The last ATA/ATAPI standard for PATA provided support for very large hard drives (144 petabytes PB) at
speed up to 133 MBps. 

Serial ATA (SATA) was introduced with ATA/ATAPI version 7.
The PATA had a range of issues, and SATA addressed them:
- Ribbon cables impreded airflow and could be a pain to insert properlyl the cables had a limited length,
  only 18 inches
- You couldn`t hot-swap PATA drives, meaning you need to shutdown device before manipulations
- Technology reached its limits in terms of throughput.

STAT creates a PTP connection between SATA device and the SATA controller, the host bus adapter (HBA).
- Because data is send serially, interface needs fat fewer physical wires - only 7 connectors instead
  of 40, resulting in much thinner cabling.
- The cable length got more than twice - about 40 inches (1 meter).
- Throughput, theriotecally 30 times faster then PATA. Comes in 3 common varieties 1.5/3/6 Gbps, which
  have a maximum throughput of 150/300/600 MBps
- Got support of hot-swap

SATAe (SATA Express) or SATA 3.2 ties capable drives directly into the PCI Express bus on motherboards.
SATAe drops both the SATA link and transport layers, embracing the full performance of PCIe.

NOTE ATA drivers are referred to as IDE (Integrated Drive Electronics) drives, meaning any hard drive with
a built-in controller.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                                Types of memory
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are two types of memory used in computer: Primary memory (Volatile) and Secondary memory (non-volatile).
Random Access Memory (RAM) is volatile memory and Read Only Memory (ROM) is non-volatile memory.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                     Discs
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CDs store data by using microscopic pits burned into a glass master CD with a laser. The CD drive reads
the pits and the non-pitted areas (lands) and converts the pattern into ones and zeros.
CDs store data on one side of the disc only.

Initially, discs were used to hold music and where divided into variable size tracks, each song gets one
track. This format was not optimal for holding generic data since had no decent error chacking. This was
addressed with a creationg of CD-ROM. It has a special format that divides the CD into fixed sectors,
each holding 2353 bytes.
Why they didn`t used FAT or something like fs? They could, but most fs formats are tieded to OS and may
be not supported by anothers, as well vendors wanted discs to be readable by other devices as well,
therefore a new ISO-9660 standard was developed. This format is sometimes referred to by CDFS (CD File
System).

Initiall discs were filled with data by vendor, which required some highly expensive equipment and
substantial expertise. The industry make a number of attempts to create a technology that would let
users record, or burn, their own CDs.
- CD-R(ecordable). Recorded dadta by using organic dyes embedded into the disc, that could be modified
  using strong laser, note, single time usage. Was much faster then initial CD-ROM discs.
  You can write to them but not erase or alter what`s written.
- CD-RW(ReWritable). The same CD-R but could be burned multiple times, making it an equivalent of flash.
  Can be written written and rewritten.
- DVD (Digital Versatile Discs). Had a range of modifcation to increase the capacity
 - Smaller pits than CD-media, and packs them much more densely
 - Comes in both SS (Single Sided) and DS (Double Sided) formats. DS holds twice amount of data as SS.
 The smallest disc is 4G comperring to 1Gb CD on avarage.
- Blue-ray. The last generation in optical disc formatting and storage technology.
  Enjoyed wild populary as a result of high quality until flash memory prices dropped in the 2010s and
  basically killed all ptical media.

=========================================================================================================
                                      RAM
=========================================================================================================
RAM variations:
1. Static (SRAM). Faster and significantly more expensive than Dynamic RAM.
   Used for cache memory, both on and off CPU. Typically a few megabytes per PC.
2. Dynamic (DRAM). Slower, less expensive.
   Used for the main memory + frame buffer of a graphics system.
   Typically hundreds or thousands of megabytes per PC.

DRAM is very popular, used for many application and had many versions during history, this include:
1. SDRAM  (Synchronus DRAM). The same DRAM but tied to the system clock, like thhe CPU and MCC, so the
   MCC knows when data is ready to be grabbed from SDRAM.
2. RDRAM (Rambus DRAM). DRAM with 800MHz speed. It was greatly anticipated by the industry for years, but
   support proved less than enthusiastic due to significant delays in development and a price many times
   that of SDRAM, yet, almost all major PC makers sold systems using it for a while.
3. DDR SDRAM (Double Data Rate SDRAM). AMD and mmany other prefered this over RDRAM.

                      |    SRAM   | DRAM
______________________|___________|_______
Transistors per bit   |    6      | 1

Your motherboard should detect and automatically set up any DIMM you install, assuming you have the right
RAM for the system, using a technology called SPD (Serial Presence Detect). RAM makers add a handy chip to
modern sticks called the SPD chip which stores all the information about your DRAM.
When a PC boots, it queries the SPD chip so that the MCC knows how much RAM information.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                      SRAM
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Each bit is stored into bistable memeory cell, which can stay indefinitely in either of two different
voltage states. Any other state is considered unstable, circuit will move to one of stable states.
An SRAM memory cell will retain its value indefinitely, as long as it is kept powered, event when a
disturbance, such as electrical noice, the circuit will return to a stable value.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                      DRAM
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Each bit is stored as charge on a capacitor. The capacitor is very small, about 30 femtofarads (10^-15).
DRAM storage can be made very dense - each cell consists of a capacitor and a signle access transistor
DRAM memory cell is very sensitive to any disturbance.

NOR flash uses no shared components and can connect individual memory cells in parallel, enabling random
access to data. It is better suited to serial rather than random data access. 

A NAND flash cell is more compact and has fewer bit lines, stringing together floating gate transistors
to increase storage density.  NOR flash is fast on data reads, but it is typically slower than NAND on
erases and writes. NAND flash consumes less power than NOR flash for write-intensive applications.

NOR flash is more expensive to produce than NAND flash and tends to be used primarily in consumer and
embedded devices for boot purposes and read-only applications for code storage. NAND flash is more suitable
for data storage in consumer devices and enterprise server and storage systems due to its lower cost per
bit to store data, greater density, and higher programming and erase (P/E) speeds.

The name flash was used after sugestion that erasure process of the memory reminded the flash of a camera.

                                 Virtualization
=========================================================================================================
OS uses porgramming called a supervisor to handle very low-level interactions among hardware and software,
such as task scheduling, allocation of time and resources. The virtualization, enabling one machine to run
multiple guest OS, reures an extra layer of sophisticated programming called a hypervisor to manage the
vastly more complex interactions.

=========================================================================================================
CPU => Central Processing Unit
MPU => Micro Processing Unti
MCU => Micro Computer Unit or micro controller, is non general purpose 'computer' used
to controll another hardware device
SOC => System on chip, is an MCU with application processor ?
MCM => Multi chip module 
PCBA => Printed Circuit Board Assemblie


JTAG => Joint Test Action Group, protocol 
Boundary scan => additional circuit on chip used for debugging. Is small element
connecting chip I/0 to external resources, one element/pin, which are interconnected
and goes to JTAG controller

| Boundary scan | ==================|
|---------------|                   |
      ||||                  =================== ---> TDO
|---------------|           | JTAG controller | <--- TDI
| Chip I/O      |           |                 | <--- TCK
|---------------|           =================== <--- TMS

TDO => data out
TDI => data in
TCK => clock
TMS => managment

JTAGs can be chanined with TDO of one circuit connected to TDI of another, this
allows you to test pins of multiple chips interconnected


BSDL (Boundary Scan Description Language) => variant of VHDL used for describing
JTAG scheme by manufacturer, needed to run boundary scan


SMT (Surface-mount technology) => is a methid for producing electronic circuits in which the components
are mounted or placed directly on the surface of PCB.

SMD (surface-mount device) => an electronic device made with SMT. They may have short pins or leads of various
styles, flat contacts, a matrix of solder balls (BGAs), or terminations on the body of the component

BGA (ball grid array) => type of surface-mount packaging used for IC. It is used to permamently mount devices such
as microprocessors. 


SPI (Serial Perhipheral Interface) => a way fro microcontrollers to communicate with each other or with
the outside world. Is just another serial port on a device?

Microcontroller programmer => hardware device + doftwware used to transfer binary to the microcontroller
EEPROM from PC. It contains a preprogrammed microcontroller which takes data from PC and using 
protocols like SPI, parallel interfacing, CAN programs the target controller. If device has a bootloader,
it can self burn, in this case there is only task to trasfer program from PC to target

If you want to program the chip through USB, the chip needs to be preprogrammed with a bootloader from the
factory, The bootloader is called DFU Bootloader?

                                   Batteries
=========================================================================================================
Basics. Common batteries, such as AAA, AA, C and D, have positive and negative terminals and two ineternal
layers called electrodes that include a cathode (which transports a positive charge) and an anode (to carry
a negative charge). All batteries also have some type of electrolyte—a substance that conducts electricity
(a flow of electrons) between the battery’s terminals. When you put a battery in a device, like a headlamp,
the electrolyte, cathode and anode interact and a chemical reaction (basically oxidation) occurs.
Ions (positively charged) and electrons (negatively charged) flow through the electrolyte, exit via the
negative terminal and enable your device to function.
Over time, a battery's internal chemicals begin to degrade and interaction diminishes. Eventually they can
no longer retain a charge and are considered “dead.”
The mix of chemicals in a battery aims to provide some combination of the four holy grails of the elusive
"ideal" battery—long life, high performance, reasonable cost and low environmental impact. 

Finger battaries size are identified according to alphabet, where the further you get through the alphabet,
the larget the battery. Letters can be duplicated to show that battery is a bit smaller,
e.g., A vs AA vs AAA.
As well, there are coin/button cell batteries. These have another form and naming scheme, usually 2 letters
followed by 4 numbers:
- 1 letter  -> chemical composition
- 2 letter  -> shape
- 4 numbers -> size of the battery, 2 for diameter and 2 for height
CR2032 -> C is Lithium, R stands for roundm 20mm in diameter and 3.2mm high
