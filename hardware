                                   Baud rate
=========================================================================================================
Baud rate. Rate at which information is trasferred in a communication channel. In the serial port context
9600 baud means that hte serial port is capable of transferring a maximum of 9600 bits/second. The higher
the baud rate, the more sensitive the cable becomes to the quality of installation, such as how much of
the wire is untwisted around each device.
The most common RS232 format requires 10 bits to send each byte, so at 9600 baud you can send 960 bytes
per second.
A baud rate can also be expressed in kHz, so 9600 baud is 9.6kHz. It means the same thing

To get characteristics of your terminal or serial port issue `stty -F /dev/ttyS<n>`
By default serial ports are configured as terminal emulator (canonical mode). If you want to use them as
"raw" serial port you will have do `stty -F /dev/tty<S0> raw -echo -echoe -echok` 
You can write/read from such device, like
echo 123 > /dev/ttyS0
cat /dev/ttyS0

CPU => Central Processing Unit
MPU => Micro Processing Unti
MCU => Micro Computer Unit or micro controller, is non general purpose 'computer' used
to controll another hardware device
SOC => System on chip, is an MCU with application processor ?
MCM => Multi chip module 
PCBA => Printed Circuit Board Assemblie


JTAG => Joint Test Action Group, protocol 
Boundary scan => additional circuit on chip used for debugging. Is small element
connecting chip I/0 to external resources, one element/pin, which are interconnected
and goes to JTAG controller

| Boundary scan | ==================|

      ||||                  =================== ---> TDO
|---------------|           | JTAG controller | <--- TDI
| Chip I/O      |           |                 | <--- TCK
|---------------|           =================== <--- TMS

TDO => data out
TDI => data in
TCK => clock
TMS => managment

JTAGs can be chanined with TDO of one circuit connected to TDI of another, this
allows you to test pins of multiple chips interconnected


BSDL (Boundary Scan Description Language) => variant of VHDL used for describing
JTAG scheme by manufacturer, needed to run boundary scan

PCB (printed circuit board) => mechanically supports and electrically connects electronic/electrical
components using conductive tracks, pads and other features etched from one or more sheet layers
of copper laminated onto and/or betweeb sheet layers oa non-conductibe substrate. Components are both
mechanically and electrically connected to PCB. It is used for everythin except the simplest electronic
products. This about it as plastick sheet covered with elements and paths that interconnect them.
Alternatives wire wrap and point to point construction.

Wire wrap => electronic components mounted on insulating board are interconnected by lenghs of
insulated wire run between their terminals, with the connections made by wrapping several turns of
uninsulated sections of the wire around a component lead or a socket pin. It is old techology
used for telephone switches and later used for prototyping since it can be well automated and
easily fixed by hand.

IC => integrated circuit or monolithic integrated circuit (or IC, chip, microchip) is a set of electronic
circuits on one small flat piece (or 'chip') of semiconductor material that is normally silicon.

SMT (Surface-mount technology) => is a methid for producing electronic circuits in which the components
are mounted or placed directly on the surface of PCB.

SMD (surface-mount device) => an electronic device made with SMT. They may have short pins or leads of various
styles, flat contacts, a matrix of solder balls (BGAs), or terminations on the body of the component

BGA (ball grid array) => type of surface-mount packaging used for IC. It is used to permamently mount devices such
as microprocessors. 


SPI (Serial Perhipheral Interface) => a way fro microcontrollers to communicate with each other or with
the outside world. Is just another serial port on a device?

Microcontroller programmer => hardware device + doftwware used to transfer binary to the microcontroller
EEPROM from PC. It contains a preprogrammed microcontroller which takes data from PC and using 
protocols like SPI, parallel interfacing, CAN programs the target controller. If device has a bootloader,
it can self burn, in this case there is only task to trasfer program from PC to target

If you want to program the chip through USB, the chip needs to be preprogrammed with a bootloader from the
factory, The bootloader is called DFU Bootloader?
