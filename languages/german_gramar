                                    Grammar
=========================================================================================================
The German alphabet consists of 26 letters, like in English, but also contains three vowels with umlauts
(ä, ö, ü) and one ligature called a scharfes S or Eszett (ß). 

In English, we capitalize some words, like people’s names. In German, you capitalize all nouns!
Kaffee und Tee

German has six tenses:
Pra:sens                        | present
Perfekt                         | present perfect
Pra:teritum                     | simple past
Plusquamperfekt                 | past perfect
Futur 1                         | future
Futue 2                         | future perfect

In German, every noun has a specific gender; masculine, feminine, or neutral.
The gender of German nouns can be determined by looking at the article preceding it.
The definite articles, meaning “the” in English

Definite Article | Gender abbr       | Example 
der (the)        | masculine (m)     | der Löffel (the spoon)
die (the)        | feminine (f)      | die Gabel (the fork)
das (the)        | neutral (n or nt) | das Messer (the knife)
die (the)        | plural (pl)       | die Menschen (the people)

These also have an indefinite equivalent meaning “a” or “an” in English
ein    | masculine
eine   | feminine
ein    | neutral

Definite articles and indefinite articles in German don’t behave exactly like they do in English.
They are declined differently depending on the gender, the number, and the case of the corresponding noun.

The four cases in German grammar are definitely an added complexity:
- Nominative case. The basic form of a noun and is used for nouns that are the subject of a sentence —
  the “who” or “what” is performing the action. We like this case because the article appears in its
  standard form and does not change.
- Accusative case. Used for the “thing” or “person” receiving the direct action of a verb — the direct object.
  The accusative case also follows certain verbs and prepositions no matter if it relates to the direct
  object or not.
- Dative case. Used for the “person” or “thing” receiving the indirect action of a verb — the indirect object.
  Similar to the accusative case, the dative case also follows certain verbs and prepositions no matter if
  it relates to the indirect object or not.
- Genitive case. Indicates possession. To mark the genitive case, an -s or -es is added to nouns in German
  grammar. Certain verbs and prepositions also follow the genitive case no matter if it relates to
  possession or not.

            |  Masculine | Feminine | Neutral |  Plural
----------------------------------------------------------
Nominative  |  der       |   die    |   das   |    die
            |  ein       |  eine    |   ein   |     -
Accusative  |  den       |   die    |   das   |    die
            |  einen     |  eine    |   ein   |     -
Dative      |  dem       |   der    |   dem   |    den
            |  einem     |  einer   |   einem |     -
Genitive    |  des       |   der    |   des   |    der
            |  eines     |  einer   |   eines |     -

When German nouns become plural, they adopt the feminine definite article of die. So, der/die/das become
die/die/die. For example, der Mann becomes die Männer.

                                    Genders
=========================================================================================================
It’s not just words for people that have gender — all words do! For example, words like Bär and Hund are
masculine, while Eule and Katze are feminine. Basically, you have three genders in German — masculine,
feminine, and neuter — and although English has the same three genders, they play a very different role
in German grammar.

Gender in English is what’s called natural gender; for instance, boy and girl are examples of masculine
and feminine gender words, while computer is an example of a neuter gender word.
In German, most gender is unnatural. So instead of referring to a word’s meaning, gender refers to the word
itself.

So how do you know if a word is feminine or masculine? Unfortunately, it’s not always logical — it’s just
something you’ll have to learn. So when you’re learning German words, don’t just memorize Bär or Katze.
Instead, memorize the whole phrase, `der Bär` or `die Katze`.

Gender is critical to the German language, specifically in terms of grammatical structures. There are
various concepts that rely on the gender of German nouns, such as adjective endings, articles, pronouns
and plural forms, to name a few.

The gender of some words varies by meaning.  The plurals are often different too.
der Tor (fool)          |                          | das Tor (gate)   
der Band (volume)       | die Band (musical band)  | das Band (ribbon) 
der/das Kiefer (jaw)    | die Kiefer (pine,tree)   |
                        | die Steuer (taxes)       | das Steuer (rudder, steering-wheel) 
                        |                          |
der Leiter (leader)     | die Leiter (ladder)      |
der Gehalt (contents)   |                          | das Gehalt (salary)
der Golf  (gulf)        |                          | das Golf  (golf)
der Heide  (pagan)      | die Heide (heath, moor)  |  
der Messer  (gauge)     |                          | das Messer (knife)
der Moment  (moment)    |                          | das Moment (element, factor)
der Schild (shield)     |                          | das Schild  (sign)
der Kunde (customer)    | die Kunde (information)  |
der Weise (wise man)    | die Weise (way, manner)  |
der See (lake)          | die See (sea, ocean)     |
der Verdienst (merit)   |                          | das Verdienst (earnings)


Some words have a gender that varies by dialect, region or country:
die Butter in Germany, der Butter in Austria.
Das Radio in northern Germany, der Radio in the south and Austria.
Mainly das Marzipan in the Federal Republic and der Marzipan in Austria.
Der/Das Bonbon       | candy
Der/Das Salbei       | sage
Der/Das Schrot       | whole wheat
Der/Die Sellerie     | celery
Der/Das Sims         | sill, ledge
Der/Das Virus        | virus
Der/Das Joghurt      | yogurt
Der/Das Keks         | cookie
Der/Das Liter        | liter
Das/Der Poster       | poster

When you have multy gender words, in Germany the masculine article is the most common; the neuter is
rather rare. In Switzerland and Austria, the neuter article is mainly used, although in eastern Austria -
and especially the area around Vienna - the female article is rarely used in everyday language.

Strategies for learning the gender:
- Just guess. The German Duden gives figures of 46% feminine, 34% masculine and 20% neuter.
  There are also other figures out there (Baayen, Piepenbrock, & Gulikers, 1995) suggesting masculine 43%,
  feminine 38% and neuter 19% are neuter. However, these figures – among other problems – don’t necessarily
  reflect the frequency of words.
  All we can say is, if you must guess, don’t guess neuter
- Color coding. Use flashcards to learn words, just paint them in some specific color to describe the gender.
- Mental images. Supercharged version of colour coding is to choose three memorable images – one neuter,
  one masculine, one feminine – to associate with each word of the corresponding gender.
  Die Waage  | Items on the scales for feminime
  Der Hammer | Items smashed for masculine
  Der Wasser | Items in lake of water for neuter
- Examine common chunks you might become very familiar with early on.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              Identifying a Gender
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To point out the gender of nouns, you use different gender markers. The three gender markers that mean
`the` (singular) in German are der (masculine) die (feminine) and das (neuter).
The plural form of the definite article is die. English has only one gender marker for the definite article
of all nouns, namely `the`.

Some categories of nouns are consistently masculine, feminine, or neuter. For instance, noun gender usually
follows the gender of people: der Onkel (the uncle) and die Schwester (the sister).
In many other cases, the noun categories have to do with the ending of the noun.

Common Genders by Noun Ending (or Beginning):
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usually Masculine (der)           | Usually Feminine (die)               |  Usually Neuter (das)

                                  | -schaft                              |

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Typical feminine endings:
 -a      | except -ma – see neuter, below

 -heit/-keit  | die Gesundheit, die Schönheit
Watch out too for the “weak” masculine nouns – the “n-Deklination”: der Bursche, der Affe and masculine
or neuter adjectival nouns such as der Alte or der Blinde.

Typical masculine endings:
 -ast   | der Ast, der Palast
 -er    | when referring to people, like der Arbeiter, der Lehrer – see below for corresponding female forms
 -ich   | der Teppich, der Meerrettich
 -ig    | der Käfig, der Honig
 -ling  | der Lehrling, der Flüchtling

 -en    | infinitives used as nouns like das Gehen, das Teetrinken das Gehen
 -ett   | often loan words – das Tablett
 -icht  | das Licht
 -il    | das Wohnmobil but der Stil
 -it    | das Dynamit
 -lein  | das Fräulein
 -ment  | often loan words like das Medikament (drug, das Appartement, das Testament but der Zement
 -o     | das Büro, das Konto but TAKE GOOD NOTE – der Espresso:
 -ma das Thema    | often loan words remember die Oma!

Back into neutral:
 -tel   | das Drittel
 -tum   | often loan words but Germanic ones too, such as das Wachstum
 -um    | often loanwords like das Studium, das Album. Note: der Reichtum

The above ending groups are a more reliable guide than the meaning groups that are below.
There are also endings which TEND to have a certain gender but where there are far more exceptions:
  -el, -er, -en endings are 60% masculine, 25% feminines and 15% neuter (on the latter – see above).
Nouns with the prefix “ge-” are 90% neuter (but der Gewinn profit, die Geburt, die Geschichte)
der Gehalt (in the sense of “contents” (das Gehalt – “salary”))).
Nouns ending -nis and -sal are often neuter (about 70% – das Gebäude, das Gespräch, the rest feminine –
die Besorgnis, die Erkenntnis). 

Common Genders by Noun Subject:

Regarding the members of a profession: In English, to be inclusive, the preference is to ditch the old
female forms. In German you do the opposite. Many masculine nouns for jobs can be made feminine by adding 
-in (plural – innen): Lehrer/-in; Steuerberater/-in (tax advisor), Budeskanzlerin.

Compound nouns. The combined words can be not only nouns, but also adjectives, adverbs, verb stems, and
prepositions. However, the last element of the compound must be a noun.
German also allows for the invention of new compounds. The last word in the compound always determines
the gender and plural form of the compound noun.
    der Arm + das Band + die Uhr = die Armbanduhr (watch)
    das Haupt + die Stadt = die Hauptstadt (capital city)
    geh(en) + der Weg = der Gehweg (walkway)
    schnell + der Zug = der Schnellzug (fast train)
    ab + die Fahrt = die Abfahrt (departure) Almost always take the gender of the last element:
    die Autobahn
    der Sozialversicherungsfachangestelltenauszubildender
Some words require an -n-, -en-, -s- or -es- between the combined words.
    der Bund + -es- + das Land = das Bundesland (federal state)
    die Straße + -n- + das Schild = das Straßenschild (street sign)
