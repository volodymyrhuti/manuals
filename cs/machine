Algebra. A set of objects (symbols) and rules to manipulate these objects.
Linear algebra. The study of vectors and certain rules to manipulate vectors.

For a systematic approach to solving systems of linear equations we will introduce a useful compact
notation. We collect the coefficients a_ij into vectors and collect the vectors into matrices.
Matrices can be used to compactly represent systems of linear equations, but they also represent linear
functions (linear mappings).
